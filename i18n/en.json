  "projectDescription": "# About the project\n\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) [Climate Change Initiative (CCI)](https://climate.esa.int/) programme aims to provide stable, long-term, satellite-based Essential Climate Variable (ECV) data products to the scientific community and general public. Based on Earth Observation (EO) archives that ESA together with its member states have established over the last 30 years, the CCI programme adds significant and timely contributions to the ECV databases required by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ([UNFCCC](https://unfccc.int/)).\n\nESA's Climate Change initiative is organised in different themes:\n- Development of Essential Climate Variables\n- Cross-ECV scientific exploitation of the data products\n- Knowledge Exchange\n\nThe objective for Knowledge Exchange activities within CCI is to maximise awareness, access, use\nand understanding of satellite data for climate research with an emphasis on promoting the CCI\nProgramme as a whole.\n\nThe role of the Climate from Space application (this application) within those objectives is to increase the visibility of the CCI programme and the role of ESA satellite data in climate science. It addresses a general public and educational audience as well as representing ESA climate office at exhibition environments.",
