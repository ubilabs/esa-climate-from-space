      "description": "Throughout history, humans have used fire as an environmental management tool. Vegetation characteristics, mainly biomass loads and moisture, determine fire behaviour, but fire also modifies vegetation structure and evolution. Climate affects fire occurrence through the thermal and precipitation cycles, but it is also affected by fire, particularly through emissions of gases and particulate matter. This mutual influence between vegetation, climate and fire highlights the importance of having global long-term information on burned area (BA) as an input for climate and vegetation modellers.\n\nCurrently, the  CCI Fire  product includes 19 years of global burned area data. The product is offered at 250m resolution with date of fire detection and the land cover type that was burned, and at  quarter-degree cells with total BA per grid cell,  total BA per land cover type, and observed area.

Currently, the CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere is increasing by around 0.5 % every year, which is mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas).

A good understanding of the variable methane sources and sinks is important in order to reliably predict our future climate. Global satellite data helps with this and thus contributes to improving climate predictions. As can be seen, atmospheric methane concentrations vary with time and location. This is primarily due to strongly fluctuating sources such as wetlands and rice cultivation. Other important methane emissions come from oil, gas and coal extraction and their transport and utilisation, as well as from certain animals (especially ruminants such as cattle and sheep). Satellite data also helps to identify strong localised methane sources and quantify their emission levels. In this way, leaks can be found and, if necessary, closed.  The data shown here is based on the analysis of radiation measurements from the European Sentinel-5 precursor satellite by the University of Bremen as part of the ESA GHG-CCI project (https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/ghgs/). The vertically averaged methane mixing ratio is shown in ppb (parts per billion).

The mass change estimation is based on the tailored sensitivity kernel approach developed at TU Dresden.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Gravimetric Mass Balance (GMB)  \n\n**Time Span:** April 2002 - July 2020   \n\n**Temporal Resolution:** monthly  \n\n**Geographic Extent:** Antarctic \n\n**Spatial Resolution:** 50km x 50km  \n\n**Version:** v3.0  \n\n**DOI:** [10.5285/36dae49c76f845a18062fa96599be719](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/36dae49c76f845a18062fa96599be719)  \n  \n[ESA CCI Ice Sheets Arctic ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/ice-sheets-antarctic/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/36dae49c76f845a18062fa96599be719)",

Its assessment and the monitoring of its dynamics are of extreme importance for the correct estimation of Earth radiation budget. Moreover, LC is correlated to land use and by proxy allows the study of how human activities impact on the Climate. Land Cover has a key role on surface energy, water and carbon fluxes variables. Moreover, Land cover change has an impact on radiative, aerodynamic, evaporative properties, carbon storage with different effects on surface temperature and precipitation.\n\nThe CCI High Resolution Land Cover project has developed regional time series of land-cover maps based on multitemporal and multisensor satellite observations in the visibile, infrared and microwave  wavelength  using Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Landsat 4-5-7, ASAR, ERS-1 and ERS-2 data.

This physical variable might also be referred to as Water Surface Elevation (WSE). These river water level time series have been computed in at 54 locations (within 18 river basins). The data has been derived from nadir viewing satellite radar altimeter missions (ERS-2, Envisat, Saral, Topex-Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A/B and Sentinel 6). The data shown corresponds to water level anomalies, i.e. water level time series minus the temporal mean of the time series.\nWater level is a proxy of river discharge and is therefore on of the satellite-data used by the project to estimate river discharge, which corresponds to the volume of water passing through a river cross section per unit of time.\nAround 40% of precipitations on the continents goes to the oceans through river networks. It is an important flux of water on the continents and it is affected both by climate change and direct human activities. The ESA river discharge CCI project is a precursor study, aiming at deriving long term (at least over 20-years) river discharge time series at selected locations in the river network of some river basins.\n\nBiancamaria, S.; Boussaroque, M.; Gal, L.; Kitambo, B.; Lefebve, J.; Papa, F.; Paris, A.; Vayre, M.; Zakharova, E.

The increased cloud cover and rainfall in northeast Australia was due to a disruption of temperature and evaporation patterns in the central Pacific Ocean known as [La Niña](stories/story-16/6). So much water accumulated on the land that an 18-month drop was recorded in mean global sea level. \r\n\r\nThis event shows how different parts of the Earth system – ocean, atmosphere and land – and locations separated by thousands of kilometres, are linked by the water cycle. It is a key component of Earth’s climate.\r\n\r\n## A Precious Resource\r\n\r\nWater is the world’s most precious resource. Without it there would be no life. Water has sculpted Earth’s landscape; we use it to grow crops and raise livestock, to generate electricity, in industrial processes, for transport and recreation. Lack of water puts life at risk in times of drought or wildfire. But water itself can also be a hazard. It may carry disease and pollutants, and too much water can cause damage and loss of life during times of flood or storm. The Queensland floods of 2010–11 affected 200,000 people and 35 died. Twenty-two people died in the similarly wet autumn of 2022.\r\n\r\nPakistan was hit by its worst ever floods in August 2022, after extremely heavy monsoon rains powered by the rapidly-warming Indian Ocean coincided with the summer melting of Himalayan glaciers. About one third of the country was inundated, taking the lives of more than 1100 people and affecting 33 million. \r\n\r\nSuch extreme events are expected to become more frequent as the climate warms.",

When it reaches 100 percent, the air is saturated and water condenses around tiny particles of sand, salt, volcanic ash and soot (collectively known as aerosols) to form clouds of liquid water droplets. These water droplets are tiny, relatively buoyant, and can easily evaporate in less humid air, so not all clouds bring rain.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of a cloud depend on the number and type of aerosol particles: for example, more particles produce more and smaller droplets, which make the cloud brighter. More droplets form if the supply of water is maintained, or if the air cools, allowing it to carry less moisture. Air cools as it rises to pass over high ground, or if it moves over a cold ocean current or land mass. \r\n\r\n## Cloud Distribution\r\n\r\nThe data globe shows areas of heavy cloud cover, such as the persistent band of rising warm, moist air over the Equator.

Ice crystals group together and fall to the ground as hailstones or snowflakes. During the northern winter snow covers up to 47 million square kilometres – about half the northern hemisphere’s land surface. It is released as huge amounts of meltwater in spring and summer. \r\n\r\nIn cold regions, fallen snow can survive the summer thaw and accumulate into permanent areas of ice – glaciers in high mountain areas across the world, and the thick [ice sheets](stories/story-15/5) that cover most of Greenland and Antarctica. Most of Earth’s fresh water – 68 per cent – is locked up in ice sheets, ice shelves and glaciers. Another 1.2 per cent is in the form of sea ice, lake ice, permafrost and snow. Together these different types of frozen water form Earth’s cryosphere. They are sensitive to even small temperature fluctuations, making them key indicators of climate change. Ice is generally found in remote and inaccessible regions, and so best monitored from space.\r\n\r\n## Melting Ice\r\n\r\nGravity causes glaciers and ice sheets to flow downhill, to either melt in the warmer air at lower altitude, or break off into the sea as icebergs. Most of this water has been in a frozen state for millions of years, but as Earth warms, melting increases and the process of release has begun. Ice sheets are currently the largest contributor to [sea level rise](stories/story-30/5) and, although ten times smaller than Antarctica, it is the Greenland Ice Sheet that is the biggest source of meltwater entering the world’s oceans. This influx of fresh water is changing the salinity, and therefore the density, of adjacent seas and this may affect ocean circulation far from the poles.

The global view offered by satellites helps, and scientists use a wide range of remote sensing technologies to monitor water from space. The European Space Agency’s [Climate Change Initiative](stories/story-32/3) is exploiting this satellite data archive to analyse some of the most important climate variables. More than half of those that can be measured from space involve or influence the water cycle: sea surface temperature and salinity, sea level, sea state, ocean colour, water vapour, cloud, aerosols, snow, soil moisture, lakes, glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost and sea ice. \r\n\r\nPutting these pieces of the jigsaw together helps us to understand how the water cycle works, how it affects the climate, and how changes to the climate might affect the water cycle. A warmer climate means more evaporation, and more precipitation as rain instead of snow. We can already see large changes in the distribution of water between the different reservoirs of the hydrosphere. Some of these redistributions are temporary, such as the shift from sea to land in the wake of the 2010 La Niña, but some are permanent, like the shift from land and sea ice to ocean water. Although largely driven by heat from the Sun, there are signs that the water cycle is being supercharged by the warming climate.",

As the planet warms we can expect some temperate areas, such as the Canadian prairies, to become more productive, while areas closer to the Equator will struggle with more frequent droughts and become unsuitable for agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn many places, we already try to increase productivity by managing the water supply (through irrigation, for example), the light level (using artificial lighting, or intercropping low-level crops with trees) or the temperature (using greenhouses, polytunnels and mulches). \r\n\r\nMore atmospheric carbon dioxide may boost productivity, but only where there are enough soil nutrients available to sustain growth. Adding nutrients in the form of natural or artificial fertilisers may help improve yields where plants would otherwise struggle to thrive, and some commercial tomato growers even pump extra carbon dioxide into their greenhouses. But most of these solutions cannot be used sustainably over large areas – and many cause problems of their own.

Carbon is also returned to the atmosphere by animals eating plants and breathing out carbon dioxide. The cycling of carbon through living things is known as the fast carbon cycle.\r\n\r\nThis seasonal growth cycle can be seen in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels shown on the interactive globe: a peak is reached at the end of the northern winter, before rapidly-growing plants start absorbing carbon dioxide again in the spring. Atmospheric carbon varies most in the northern hemisphere because it has more land, and therefore more plants, than the southern hemisphere. On top of the seasonal cycle there is a clear increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from year to year – a sign that the carbon cycle is out of balance, mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels.\r\n \r\n## Carbon and the Land \r\n\r\n[Changes in land use and land cover](stories/story-28/3) are also altering the carbon cycle.

Nineteenth century scientists looked to atmospheric chemistry for an explanation of the climate changes that took us in and out of ice ages. Carbon dioxide was identified as a greenhouse gas by US scientist Eunice Foote in 1856 and Irish scientist John Tyndall in 1859. Then, in 1896, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius was the first to quantify the warming effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide and to recognise that carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels could cause global temperature to rise. \r\n\r\nAfter a year of “tedious calculations” Arrhenius concluded that a hypothetical doubling of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would make global temperatures rise by about 5 degrees Celsius (5°C). The field of climate modelling has of course moved on since then, but Arrhenius wasn’t far off: scientists now expect a rise in temperatures of 2.3-4.5 °C if carbon dioxide concentration doubles. This ‘climate sensitivity’ is still a key measure in climate science, although there are many other factors to be taken into account when modelling the climate. \r\n\r\nSince Arrhenius’ time we have seen atmospheric carbon dioxide rise by about a half, and global average temperature rise by about 1.2°C. We now have deeper understanding of the physics, chemistry and biology influencing the climate, and powerful computers to perform the tedious calculations and show tables of numbers as colour-coded maps. Scientists have also developed ways of measuring many individual climate variables, including building up decades of global observations from space.",

This is where our weather is cooked up.\r\n\r\nHigher sea surface temperatures lead to more evaporation. More water vapour in the atmosphere potentially means more clouds and more rain. Warmer water in the western Mediterranean is a key factor in the sudden rainstorms and flash floods that afflict the coasts of France, Italy and Spain in late summer.\r\n\r\nOn a larger scale, high temperatures in tropical oceans power extreme weather events such as hurricanes. The energy exchange between ocean and atmosphere during these events is shown by a dip in the sea surface temperature in the wake of large hurricanes.  \r\n \r\n## Climate Indicators\r\nIn 2020 forecasters reached the end of the alphabet when naming Atlantic storms and had to resort to Greek letters for only the second time (the first was 2005). While it is not clear that there will be more hurricanes in a warming world, there is evidence that storms are becoming more powerful, so we are likely to see more of the most damaging Category 4 and 5 hurricanes.\r\n\r\nWhile atmospheric weather systems can quickly move energy around the planet, the ocean’s much greater heat capacity makes it a better indicator of longer-term climate trends. The sea is an important regulator of the climate, and the temperature of its surface a key measurement for climate scientists. The rise in global average air temperature slowed down in the first decade of this century, causing some to question global warming.

There are high chlorophyll concentrations off the coasts of Peru, Argentina and Namibia. In these areas, prevailing winds push the surface water offshore and cold, deep water rises to replace it, bringing to the surface the nutrients on which the plankton thrive. \r\n\r\nSince phytoplankton are at the base of many oceanic food chains, there are generally many fish and other sea creatures in areas rich in plankton. Modern fishing fleets, therefore, use SST maps from satellites to help find and follow fish on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nPhytoplankton also play a key role in the climate, since they use chlorophyll to absorb carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, just as plants do on land.

Where the North Atlantic meets cold Arctic air masses, the ocean is rapidly cooled and the formation of sea ice leaves excess salt in the water. Cooler, saltier water is more dense and will sink. Similar processes are at work around Antarctica in the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe interactive globe shows the salinity of the ocean’s surface. It is low where major rivers discharge freshwater into the ocean. The highest values show where salt is left behind during evaporation – in the almost enclosed Mediterranean and Red Seas – or during sea ice formation, such as in the Greenland Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen the very dense water created where sea ice forms sinks, it embarks on a thousand-year journey into the deep ocean and around the world as part of the ‘Great Ocean Conveyor Belt’, more formally known as the thermohaline circulation. Descending water off Norway and Greenland helps pull the North Atlantic Drift and Gulf Stream currents, with their warm tropical water, towards the North pole. The thermohaline circulation is a key component of the global climate system. \r\n\r\n## Heat Sink\r\nThe connection between the ocean surface and the large mass of the deep ocean provided by the thermohaline circulation, together with the vertical motion of waves and tides, has helped the ocean absorb more than 90% of the excess heat built up over the last 50 years of global warming, sparing most of us from the full effects of our greenhouse gas emissions. But, as this heat penetrates deeper waters, there is no guarantee that the ocean will continue to absorb heat at this rate.",

These are the warm and cool phases of a recurring climate cycle across the tropical Pacific – the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO.\r\n\r\n## El Niño\r\nDuring El Niño, the east-to-west trade winds across the equatorial Pacific weaken. This causes a build-up of warm water in the eastern Pacific and supresses the upwelling of cold water. As the warm water builds up the increased evaporation of sea water leads to an increase in cloud cover, which can leave Asia, Australia and even Africa experiencing very dry years. \r\n\r\n## La Niña\r\nWhen El Niño ends, the cold water sometimes returns stronger than ever, clearing a gap in the clouds as the local climate enters its cool phase – La Niña.

The sensor measured so little ozone in the atmosphere over Antarctica that the readings were flagged as possible errors. But not long afterwards, British and Japanese researchers recorded similarly low amounts of ozone from their Antarctic research stations.\r\n \r\nIt was only when the ground-based results were published in the scientific literature that the low values in the satellite data were explained. They showed a wide area with very low amounts of ozone developing every spring over the South Pole. This ‘hole’ in Earth’s protective ozone layer quickly gained the attention of the media and policy-makers. And, with their data verified, scientists gained confidence in the emerging technology of [Earth observation from space](stories/story-26/0).\r\n\r\n## Protective Layer \r\n\r\nThe layer of ozone high up in the stratosphere is our main defence against the Sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Without it we’d suffer sunburn after a few minutes outdoors, followed by eye damage and skin cancer after prolonged exposure. Unfiltered, ultraviolet light would have prevented the development of life on Earth.  \r\n\r\nBecause it also absorbs solar radiation at infrared wavelengths, ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas. Change in the distribution of ozone is the second largest human impact on the climate, after the increase in carbon dioxide. But, while ozone *loss* has been the concern in the stratosphere, ozone has been *increasing* at ground level. Here, ozone associated with transport and industrial pollution is a hazard to human health. Whether ozone is good or bad for you depends on where you find it.",

There are data gaps at the poles in the winter when there is insufficient light for the instruments to work.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric sampling from balloons and aircraft identified the causes of ozone depletion as man-made gases, particularly the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used as a propellant in aerosol sprays, fire extinguishers and pesticides, and as a coolant in refrigerators and air conditioners. Most of these gases are harmless for human beings, but once they reach the stratosphere they are hit by solar radiation that changes their molecular structure, releasing atoms of chlorine. \r\n\r\nA single atom of chlorine can split apart a large number of ozone molecules. Although ozone depletion is a global process, atmospheric conditions including wind patterns, extremely low temperatures and stratospheric ice clouds concentrate it in the springtime in the polar regions, particularly over Antarctica.\r\n\r\nIn 1987 severe limits on CFC emissions were agreed at an intergovernmental conference in Montreal. The wide adoption of the Montreal Protocol and the identification of safer alternatives means that CFCs have largely been phased out of use, and the ozone layer is slowly recovering. It is a good example of international cooperation to address a threat to the global environment.

By absorbing ultraviolet radiation ozone warms the surrounding air, so ozone loss has cooled the stratosphere. This can influence atmospheric circulation patterns, such as shifting the position of the jet stream. Beneath the ozone hole, stronger winds blowing off Antarctica may be partly responsible for the observed increase in Southern Ocean sea ice.\r\n\r\nBut stratospheric ozone depletion lets more solar energy through to the troposphere below. Here, ground-level ozone and other greenhouse gases absorb that energy. So ozone changes are pulling the temperature in opposite directions in the stratosphere and the troposphere. The overall effect has been a warming of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n## Ground-level Ozone \r\n\r\nAlthough most ozone is found in the stratosphere – above about 15km in altitude – some is present lower down in the troposphere. Here it is formed when light interacts with combustion by-products from cars and industry, mainly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). At ground level, ozone is harmful to human health, causing breathing difficulties that contribute to about half a million premature deaths every year. It also has a detrimental impact on vegetation growth, reducing its ability to absorb carbon dioxide, leading to crop losses valued at tens of billions of euros per year.\r\n\r\nAs with stratospheric ozone, regulations have been introduced to limit the damage. Newly-manufactured vehicles must meet internationally-agreed emission controls. The use of unleaded petrol and catalytic converters has removed a lot of the ozone-forming pollutants from car exhausts over recent decades. Similar technology is applied to factory and power station smokestacks, while simpler steps like planting trees in urban areas can also help soak up ground-level ozone.",

That’s an area equivalent to the entire surface of Europe appearing and disappearing through the year. \r\n\r\nYou can see the annual expansion and contraction of the frozen sea surface by scrubbing through the timeline of the interactive globe on the right. Compare the annual minimum ice extents in mid-September for the first year and the final year of the sequence. Spin the globe round to Antarctica to see the sea ice in the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe core of the ice cover is formed of layers of frozen seawater that have survived the summer thaw. This multi-year ice reaches a thickness of two to four metres in the Arctic, whereas first-year sea ice typically reaches only 1 – 1.5 metres.\r\n\r\n## Long-term trend\r\n\r\nSatellite observations show a significant loss of Arctic sea ice in recent decades, with the lowest extents observed in 2012, followed by 2007 and 2020. Since the advent of regular satellite measurements of sea ice in 1978, the Arctic Ocean’s summer sea ice extent has reduced by almost 40%. In the Southern Ocean the mean ice extent around Antarctica increased 4-6% over most of this period, but has plunged down three times faster than the Arctic from 2014. Globally the trend is down and the loss is accelerating.\r\n\r\nArctic coastlines have traditionally been protected by year-round ice.

It has a complex influence on the energy exchanges between them. Sea ice insulates the sea, reducing heat loss to the atmosphere and providing a barrier to the exchange of gases and motion. But bright ice also reflects sunlight that would be absorbed by dark ocean water, keeping the sea cooler than it would otherwise be. So, in a warming climate sea ice is subject to a positive feedback: melting ice exposes darker ocean water, which warms up, leading to further melting. \r\n\r\nThis is part of a process called the Arctic amplification. More heat is also being transported to the poles by both the atmosphere and the ocean as they warm up. This makes the Arctic one of the most sensitive regions to variations in global climate, and the place where most climate models predict the greatest warming.  Observed temperature rise in the Arctic has been 2-3 times the global average. \r\n\r\n## Climate Regulator\r\nSea ice has an important influence on the global ocean circulation. When seawater freezes in the winter, it leaves salt behind, increasing the salinity and therefore the density of the surrounding water, causing it to sink. This process is one of the main drivers behind the ocean’s global vertical circulation (the [thermohaline circulation](stories/story-16/5)), which helps distribute energy around the planet. \r\n\r\nWhen the sea ice melts in the summer, it produces an influx of fresh water, adding to that from large rivers running in from Siberia and North America. This makes the Arctic Ocean much fresher than the salty Atlantic and Pacific. Ocean circulation is partly driven by temperature and salinity differences in the water, so changes to the cycle of sea ice freezing and melting can affect ocean currents and weather systems far from the Arctic.",

In some areas, sea level rise can be five times that of the global average. This is mostly because variations in the amount of heat stored lead to uneven thermal expansion. This and other factors tend to amplify the sea level rise in tropical regions such as the central Pacific. Differences in salinity and local gravity also play a part.\r\n\r\nAbsolute measurements of sea level show the trend over years and decades. Changes from month to month show up more clearly if we work out sea level anomalies by calculating the difference between the level each month and a reference level. On the interactive globe this baseline is the average sea surface height at each point over the period 1993 to 2009. Run through the timeline to see where the sea is unusually high or low compared with mean sea level for a particular month.  \r\n\r\nThe most extreme sea level variations are usually around strong ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio Current in the North Pacific, where the motion of the current on the rotating Earth causes a slope in the sea surface. These currents are also clearly visible in the sea surface temperature data, shown on the other globe.\r\n\r\nThere is a seasonal cycle due to thermal expansion: sea levels are higher in the summer when the sea surface temperature increases. Sea level is, therefore, a good way of tracking the [movement of heat around the oceans](stories/story-16/0) as well as the movement of water itself. Unlike measurements of the temperature of the sea surface, measurements of sea level are sensitive to changes integrated over the ocean’s depth.\r\n\r\nThe globes also show variation between years, such as changes caused by the warming of the Pacific Ocean surface during [El Niño events](stories/story-16/6). Check out the El Niño years of 1997, 2003, 2010 and 2015 to see how much the sea level rises around Kiribati in the central Pacific.",

Identifying the individual contributors to sea level rise involves tracking water as it moves around the world in all its states – solid, liquid and gas – and this makes it one of the most complicated challenges in climate science. ESA’s [Climate Change Initiative](stories/story-32/3) has examined records of satellite data collected since the 1990s covering sea level, the temperature of the sea surface and the thickness of the polar ice sheets, and information about the world’s glaciers going back to the 1960s. \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that in the decade 2003–2013, 36% of sea level rise was meltwater from the [Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets](stories/story-15/5); 30% was due to [thermal expansion](stories/story-16/0); 20% from [melting glaciers](stories/story-21/6); and 10% was due to [groundwater extracted from aquifers](stories/story-21/5) for domestic, industrial and agricultural use that is ultimately discharged to the oceans. Although the contributions are all following an upward trend, they vary through time and don’t always add up to the observed total sea level rise. Bridging this gap in our knowledge is known as closing the sea level budget, and is an important focus for climate scientists. \r\n\r\nThe integration of new data from ESA satellites such as CryoSat and Copernicus Sentinels-3 and -6 will improve our knowledge of this key climate variable.

The annual bushfire season usually affects the grassland and shrubland of the interior, but this year large parts of the coastal forests burned as the country was hit by a severe heatwave, following years of drought. In addition to the human cost of the fires, it is estimated that a billion animals perished – an indication of the complexity of a forest ecosystem. Biodiversity is concentrated in forests, which contain more than 80% of all land animals and plants. Worldwide, is it estimated that a million species face extinction if forest loss continues at the current rate. As the climate warms, the time between wildfires is likely to become shorter, leaving little time for forests to recover. \r\n\r\nCoastal Australia is not the only area experiencing such extreme events. Recent years have seen extensive forest fires in other places that are not used to seeing them, including Alaska, northern Sweden and even Greenland. In Siberia, during a hot summer that set new temperature records, fires were triggered further north than usual by lightning that is becoming more frequent as the climate warms. In places, the ground itself burned when [previously frozen soil thawed](stories/story-15/5) and carbon-rich peat dried out. Such fires can continue underground for months or even years. ESA’s World Fire Atlas, which uses satellite data to monitor fires across the globe, shows there were almost five times as many wildfires in August 2019 than in August 2018 – the largest increase since the project started in 1993.\r\n\r\n## Biosphere Change\r\n\r\nFire is only the most dramatic cause of many changes to the Earth’s biosphere. We have [built cities](stories/story-27/0) across the world and even reclaimed land from the sea. Over centuries, temperate forests in Europe, Asia and North America have been [cleared for agriculture](stories/story-29/2). But the rapid reduction of tropical forests over the last fifty years is having an impact on many more species and a far greater amount of vegetation (biomass) than ever before. This, in turn, has important consequences for the global [carbon cycle](stories/story-12/0) and the world’s climate. \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that land use and land use change has released at least 180 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere since 1750, out of a total of 556 gigatonnes from human activity. Land use currently contributes about 23% of our annual greenhouse gas emissions, but plants and soil also absorb carbon. The land currently absorbs about twice as much carbon dioxide as it emits, but this will vary in response to environmental change and the picture is less clear for other greenhouse gases produced by agriculture, such as methane and nitrous oxide.",

Pigeons, foxes and, of course, humans are among the species that have adapted to survive in cities. But individual populations of other species that were more specialised, or have been driven into areas where they face greater competition, have become extinct as a result of increased urbanisation or the extension of agriculture into previously wild areas.\r\n\r\nConversely, changing climate is increasing the range of some species, allowing them to thrive in places that were previously inhospitable to them, or changing their habitats in ways that allow the population to boom. This is not always good news for everyone. For example, several years of drought and mild winters in the 2000s allowed the mountain pine beetle to extend its range from Western North America east across the Rocky Mountains, resulting in extensive damage to commercial and natural forests that had previously been free from this pest.\r\n\r\n## Protected Areas\r\n\r\nAn ecosystem with a high level of biodiversity is likely to be more resilient and be able to survive sudden changes. But if all the animals in a food web are ultimately dependent on a single type of plant, then the entire ecosystem may collapse if that plant is affected by disease or extreme weather.\r\n\r\nNational parks and other conservation areas protect a range of habitats from further development or exploitation while, in some of the best cases, continuing to support local people.  Where habitats are becoming fragmented, through, for example, deforestation or damming rivers, wildlife corridors can provide a safe route between areas for wider ranging or slower moving species, such as plants.",

It was also the last time that humans were far enough away from home  to see the whole planet for themselves. That view of a ‘blue marble’ hanging in space has become a familiar sight and is possibly the most reproduced photo in history.\r\n\r\nThe blue water of the seas and oceans dominates the picture. But if we take a closer look, we can distinguish many more colours. For instance, we can see the yellow sand of the Sahara Desert, the dark green of tropical rainforests, and the white of clouds over the oceans and ice and snow covering Antarctica.\r\n\r\nToday, Earth observation satellites take daily blue marble images that reveal a wealth of detail about our changing planet.

These applications take advantage of the different orbits that are possible for spacecraft circling the Earth. A remote sensing system needs a _sensor_ (the camera) and a _platform_ (in this case, the satellite). Different sorts of cameras can be combined with satellites in different orbits in various ways, depending on what we want to find out. \r\n\r\n## Geostationary Orbit\r\n\r\nMost weather forecast images are taken by a camera on a satellite flying in orbit 36,000 km above the Earth. Satellites like these are referred to as geostationary satellites. They move around the Earth at the same rate as the planet rotates so they are always above the same point; they always see the same side of the Earth. This path, called a geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO), allows the camera to take many pictures of the same location every day so meteorologists can track how weather systems develop. Geostationary orbits are also used by most telecommunications and TV broadcast satellites. \r\n\r\n![Geostationary and polar orbits ](assets/story26-image01.jpg) \r\n_Meteosat is in a geostationary orbit and Sentinel-5P in a polar orbit (Planetary Visions)_\r\n\r\n## Polar Orbit\r\n\r\nNot all satellites are geostationary. Others can look at the entire globe by travelling from pole to pole. These polar-orbiting satellites are in a low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of about 700 km. Polar-orbiting satellites typically take about a hundred minutes to go around the globe and their path crosses the equator about fourteen times a day. Most polar-orbiting satellites follow a very specific path called a sun-synchronous orbit. Their orbit doesn’t go right over the poles but is slightly tilted. As a result, they pass over a particular point on the equator at approximately the same local time each day. \r\n\r\nThe cameras on Sun-synchronous polar-orbiting satellites can take only one picture per day of most places on Earth. However, the images are more detailed than those taken from geostationary satellites because the camera is much closer to the Earth. Another advantage of using a Sun-synchronous orbit is that, because all the images of a certain place are taken at the same time of day, the pictures are not affected by the changes in light intensity and direction that happen naturally over the course of a day. This makes it possible to see other changes accurately, something that is essential for observing climate and measuring quantities known as essential climate variables (ECVs). ECVs give an indication of the health of our planet, in the same way that taking your pulse can tell a doctor about your health.",

By detecting red, green and blue light, the human eye – and the sensor in a standard digital camera – ‘see’ a full range of colours. Satellite cameras can gather much more information about our planet by looking beyond the visible wavelengths into other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and each region reveals different aspects of Earth’s character.\r\n\r\nAs we traverse the electromagnetic spectrum, the globe’s appearance changes as different parts of the Earth system come into view. At visible wavelengths (400–700 nanometres), optical sensors record the outline of lake and ocean shorelines, glaciers, urban areas and the colour changes due to phytoplankton in the ocean, an important carbon sink. Click through the image gallery to see how satellites see Earth at other wavelengths.\r\n\r\n## Shorter Wavelengths\r\nUltraviolet wavelengths are absorbed by ozone in the atmosphere. Sensors detecting this range of wavelengths played an important part in the discovery of the [ozone hole](stories/story-8/1) above Antarctica, and are still used to track how it is changing. X-rays and gamma rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light (less than 10 nanometres). They are used in astronomy (and in medicine), but not by Earth observation satellites.\r\n\r\n## Longer Wavelengths\r\n\r\nNear-infrared wavelengths (about 1 micrometre) are used to measure the [vigour of plant growth](stories/story-29/3) on land, helping to keep track of agricultural productivity and the impact of stresses such as drought. The mid-infrared shows [water vapour in the atmosphere](stories/story-21/3). Using the same principles as the handheld thermal cameras used for temperature screening at some airports, the thermal infrared (wavelength about 10 micrometre) allows us to measure the temperature of the land and [sea surface](stories/story-16/2)  and the tops of clouds. The far infrared reveals information about the energy radiated by the Earth and energy exchanges in the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nAt even longer wavelengths, microwaves (about 1 centimetre) can reveal the presence of  water in all its forms: as liquid in the soil, frozen as snow and ice, and as vapour and water droplets in the atmosphere. Microwaves can penetrate clouds, so microwave sensors are able to provide data under most weather conditions and even in the prolonged dark of the polar winter. Microwaves emitted by the Earth allow us to monitor snow and [sea ice extent](stories/story-15/3) and [soil moisture](stories/story-21/5). \r\n\r\nActive microwave sensors, including radar, generate their own microwaves, much as a torch generates light. Detecting the reflected microwave energy allows us to track the motion of ice and, with radar altimeters, we can measure the [thickness of sea ice](stories/story-15/7) and ice sheets, and the height of ocean waves.",

This will improve the precision of each greenhouse gas budget and help separate natural fluxes from agricultural and fossil fuel emissions.\r\n\r\nThis work will help us gauge whether we can stay within the 1.5°C carbon budget, or if we’ll have to deal with the more severe consequences of further warming.\r\n\r\n(Data from CCI RECAPP2, Greenhouse Gases, Land Cover, Biomass, Fire, Ocean Colour projects, Global Carbon Project, UN World Population Prospects 2019.

We should expect ocean temperature to rise twice as fast as we have seen so far, and be prepared for the consequences.\r\n\r\nSince warmer water expands, ocean temperature is a major driver of sea level rise. Warmer surface water also fuels hurricanes and typhoons, increasing their strength and frequency. The acceleration in ocean warming amplifies natural climate cycles such as El Niño, strengthening their impacts. It also worsens ocean heatwaves, which damage marine ecosystems - often irreversibly - costing billions of euros in losses for fisheries and aquaculture.\r\n\r\nThe high quality datasets developed by [ESA’s Climate Change Initiative](stories/story-32/3) aim to create the longest time span of data records possible from space, helping researchers to uncover new knowledge about the processes driving the climate system.
