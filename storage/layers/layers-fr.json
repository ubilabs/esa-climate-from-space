    "description": "Throughout history, humans have used fire as an environmental management tool. Vegetation characteristics, mainly biomass loads and moisture, determine fire behaviour, but fire also modifies vegetation structure and evolution. Climate affects fire occurrence through the thermal and precipitation cycles, but it is also affected by fire, particularly by gaseous and PM emissions. This mutual influences among vegetation, climate and fire highlight the importance of having global long-term burned area (BA) information that serves as input for climate and vegetation modellers.\nCurrently, the FireCCI51 BA product includes 19 years of global BA data. The product is offered at 250m resolution with date of detection and land cover burned, and at 0.25 degree cells with total BA per grid cell,  total BA per land cover, and observed area. In both cases, uncertainty layers are also incorporated.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Total Burned Area in Square Meters  \n**Time Span:** January 2001 – December 2019  \n**Temporal Resolution:** monthly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Spatial Resolution:**  0.25 x 0.25 degree  \n**Version:** 5.1  \n**DOI:**  [10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)  \n\n[ESA CCI Fire ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/fire/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)"

SM takes a key role in the water, energy and carbon cycle due to its feedback on vegetation growth, evapotranspiration and precipitation. It favours the occurrence of floods and droughts and is therefore essential for monitoring and predicting their impact on the environment.\n\nIn CCI a long-term (~40 year long) record is created by merging multiple active (radar) and passive (radiometer) sensor based satellite SM data sets into three harmonised, daily products. The current version contains quality checked data from 1978 to 2019 from 11 different sensors. Unreliable observations - as e.g. under frozen soil conditions - are masked out in the data.

SM anomalies separate recurring seasonal/climatological variations from varying regional conditions and represent these deviations from the average conditions at each point in time. Droughts are therefore represented as negative anomalies while positive anomalies indicate “wetter than normal” conditions.\n\nIn CCI SM anomalies are calculated as differences between absolute SM observations and the SM climatology from a 20 year baseline period (1991-2010). This period is selected with regard to the available data density and quality, which can affect the derived deviations from the average conditions.

Phytoplankton are essential because they are the foundation of the marine food chain, playing a role in carbon fixation that potentially reduces human-induced carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but can also increase ocean acidification.\n\nThe Ocean Colour CCI project has created a consistent time-series by merging data from multiple ocean colour satellites, including ESA’s MERIS dataset and NASA’s SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS datasets.

The GRACE satellites have shown that the ice mass loss rate has surprising variations: After a record melt in 2012, the Greenland ice sheet melt acceleration stopped, and only resumed again after another record melt in 2019, mainly due to a number of cold summers in the 2012-2018 time frame.

    "description": "Biomass is the weight of living material in vegetation, which for forests is mainly contained in the\nwoody parts of the trees. Only above-ground biomass (AGB) can be estimated from space (and in\npractice also for most on-ground estimates). Quantitative information on forest AGB is crucial\nfor understanding climate change, since loss of AGB caused by deforestation and forest degradation\nis second only to fossil fuel burning as a source of greenhouse gases, while CO&#8322; taken from the\natmosphere by forest growth and stored in woody biomass helps to slow climate warming.\n\nThe map shows estimated forest AGB in 2017 derived mainly from the combination of the ALOS\nPALSAR-2 L-band radar and the Sentinel-1 C-band radars, with support from a range of other sensors\nand environmental datasets.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Above-ground biomass in Mg/ha  \n**Time Span:** 2017  \n**Temporal resolution:** yearly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Grid Spacing:** 100m  \n**Version:** 1  \n**DOI:** [doi:10.5285/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084)\n\n[ESA CCI Biomass ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/biomass/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084)"

    "description": "Ozone is an important trace gas in the atmosphere and protects life on Earth by absorbing most of the biologically harmful ultraviolet sunlight. In the framework of ESA’s Climate Change Initiative a high-quality global total ozone data set has been generated from space-based observations that cover the period from 1995 to present. The data record can be used to investigate the long-term evolution of ozone in the atmosphere, which is intimately coupled to climate change. Of particular interest is the search for signs of recovery from the severe thinning and damage of the ozone layer, that was caused by human activities.\n\n\n**Variable Shown:** Mean Total Ozone Column in Dobson Units  \n**Time Span:** March 1996 – June 2011  \n**Temporal Resolution:** monthly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Temporal resolution:** monthly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Version:** 1  \n\n[ESA CCI Ozone ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/ozone/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/0d2260ad4e2c42b6b14fe5b3308f5eaa)"
