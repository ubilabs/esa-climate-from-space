    "description": "Throughout history, humans have used fire as an environmental management tool. Vegetation characteristics, mainly biomass loads and moisture, determine fire behaviour, but fire also modifies vegetation structure and evolution. Climate affects fire occurrence through the thermal and precipitation cycles, but it is also affected by fire, particularly by gaseous and PM emissions. This mutual influences among vegetation, climate and fire highlight the importance of having global long-term burned area (BA) information that serves as input for climate and vegetation modellers.\nCurrently, the FireCCI51 BA product includes 19 years of global BA data. The product is offered at 250m resolution with date of detection and land cover burned, and at 0.25 degree cells with total BA per grid cell,  total BA per land cover, and observed area.

Phytoplankton are essential because they are the foundation of the marine food chain, playing a role in carbon fixation that potentially reduces human-induced carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but can also increase ocean acidification.\n\nThe Ocean Colour CCI project has created a consistent time-series by merging data from multiple ocean colour satellites, including ESA’s MERIS dataset and NASA’s SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS datasets.

The GRACE satellites have shown that the ice mass loss rate has surprising variations: After a record melt in 2012, the Greenland ice sheet melt acceleration stopped, and only resumed again after another record melt in 2019, mainly due to a number of cold summers in the 2012-2018 time frame.

    "description": "Biomass is the weight of living material in vegetation, which for forests is mainly contained in the\nwoody parts of the trees. Only above-ground biomass (AGB) can be estimated from space (and in\npractice also for most on-ground estimates). Quantitative information on forest AGB is crucial\nfor understanding climate change, since loss of AGB caused by deforestation and forest degradation\nis second only to fossil fuel burning as a source of greenhouse gases, while CO&#8322; taken from the\natmosphere by forest growth and stored in woody biomass helps to slow climate warming.\n\nThe map shows estimated forest AGB in 2017 derived mainly from the combination of the ALOS\nPALSAR-2 L-band radar and the Sentinel-1 C-band radars, with support from a range of other sensors\nand environmental datasets.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Above-ground biomass in Mg/ha  \n**Time Span:** 2017  \n**Temporal resolution:** yearly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Grid Spacing:** 100m  \n**Version:** 1  \n**DOI:** [doi:10.5285/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084)\n\n[ESA CCI Biomass ECV Project website](http://cci.esa.int/biomass)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bedc59f37c9545c981a839eb552e4084)"
