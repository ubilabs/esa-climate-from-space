    "description": "Throughout history, humans have used fire as an environmental management tool. Vegetation characteristics, mainly biomass loads and moisture, determine fire behaviour, but fire also modifies vegetation structure and evolution. Climate affects fire occurrence through the thermal and precipitation cycles, but it is also affected by fire, particularly by gaseous and PM emissions. This mutual influences among vegetation, climate and fire highlight the importance of having global long-term burned area (BA) information that serves as input for climate and vegetation modellers.\nCurrently, the FireCCI51 BA product includes 19 years of global BA data. The product is offered at 250m resolution with date of detection and land cover burned, and at 0.25 degree cells with total BA per grid cell,  total BA per land cover, and observed area. In both cases, uncertainty layers are also incorporated.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Total Burned Area in Square Meters  \n**Time Span:** January 2001 – December 2019  \n**Temporal Resolution:** monthly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Spatial Resolution:**  0.25 x 0.25 degree  \n**Version:** 5.1  \n**DOI:**  [10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)  \n\n[ESA CCI Fire ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/fire/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)"

    "description": "Soil moisture (SM) describes the volumetric water content stored in the first few centimetres of soil. SM takes a key role in the water, energy and carbon cycle due to its feedback on vegetation growth, evapotranspiration and precipitation. It favours the occurrence of floods and droughts and is therefore essential for monitoring and predicting their impact on the environment.\n\nIn CCI a long-term (~40 year long) record is created by merging multiple active (radar) and passive (radiometer) sensor based satellite SM data sets into three harmonised, daily products. The current version contains quality checked data from 1978 to 2019 from 11 different sensors. Unreliable observations - as e.g. under frozen soil conditions - are masked out in the data. The animation in the App shows monthly aggregates of the COMBINED product of ESA CCI SM v05.2.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Volumetric Soil Moisture in m3/m3  \n**Time Span:** November 1978 – December 2019  \n**Temporal resolution:** monthly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Spatial Resolution:**  0.25 degrees  \n**Version:** 5.2  \n\n[ESA CCI Soil Moisture ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/soil-moisture/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/2d4a50f390064820a9dcc2fcf7ac4b18)"

    "shortName": "Soil Moisture – Anomalies",
    "description": "Soil Moisture (SM) states are affected by long-term climatological patterns as well as by short-term, local events. SM anomalies separate recurring seasonal/climatological variations from varying regional conditions and represent these deviations from the average conditions at each point in time. Droughts are therefore represented as negative anomalies while positive anomalies indicate “wetter than normal” conditions.\n\nIn CCI SM anomalies are calculated as differences between absolute SM observations and the SM climatology from a 20 year baseline period (1991-2010). This period is selected with regard to the available data density and quality, which can affect the derived deviations from the average conditions. The animation in the App shows monthly SM anomalies from 1991-2019 in the COMBINED product of ESA CCI SM v05.2.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Anomaly  \n**Time Span:** November 1978 – December 2019  \n**Temporal resolution:** monthly  \n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n**Spatial Resolution:**  0.25 degrees  \n**Version:** 5.2   \n\n[ESA CCI Soil Moisture ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/soil-moisture/)  \n[Soil Moisture Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/c256fcfeef24460ca6eb14bf0fe09572)"
