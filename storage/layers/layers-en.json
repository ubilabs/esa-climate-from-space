    "description": "Throughout history, humans have used fire as an environmental management tool. Vegetation characteristics, mainly biomass loads and moisture, determine fire behaviour, but fire also modifies vegetation structure and evolution. Climate affects fire occurrence through the thermal and precipitation cycles, but it is also affected by fire, particularly through emissions of gases and particulate matter. This mutual influence between vegetation, climate and fire highlights the importance of having global long-term information on burned area (BA) as an input for climate and vegetation modellers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the  CCI Fire  product includes 19 years of global burned area data. The product is offered at 250m resolution with date of fire detection and the land cover type that was burned, and at  quarter-degree cells with total BA per grid cell,  total BA per land cover type, and observed area. In both cases, uncertainty layers are also provided.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Total Burned Area in Square Meters  \r\n\n**Time Span:** January 2001 – December 2020  \r\n\n**Temporal Resolution:** monthly  \r\n\n**Geographic Extent:** global  \r\n\n**Spatial Resolution:**  0.25 x 0.25 degree  \r\n\n**Version:** 5.1  \r\n\n**DOI:**  [10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)  \r\n\r\n[ESA CCI Fire ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/fire/)  \r\n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)"

It influences energy, moisture and gas fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere; its high reflectivity (or albedo) provides a significant feedback effect in a warming climate; and its sensitivity to precipitation and temperature regimes makes it widely recognised as a fundamental indicator of climate variability and change. Snow is also a major, if not dominant, freshwater source in many alpine, high- and mid-latitude regions and an important contribution to the global water cycle.\r\n\r\nThe CCI Snow team is developing a multi-sensor daily time series with a pixel size of 1km, from the beginning of the 1980s to the present day, using data from AVHRR-2/3, ATSR-2, AATSR, MODIS, Sentinel-3A/B SLSTR and Spot/Proba-V Vegetation.

Moreover, LC is correlated to land use and by proxy allows the study of how human activities impact on the Climate. Land Cover has a key role on surface energy, water and carbon fluxes variables. Moreover, Land cover change has an impact on radiative, aerodynamic, evaporative properties, carbon storage with different effects on surface temperature and precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe CCI High Resolution Land Cover project has developed regional time series of land-cover maps based on multitemporal and multisensor satellite observations in the visibile, infrared and microwave  wavelength  using Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Landsat 4-5-7, ASAR, ERS-1 and ERS-2 data. The land cover types shown are based on the UN Land Cover Classification System (LLCCS).\n\n**Variable Shown:** Land cover class\r\n\n**Time Span:** 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005,\r\n2010, 2015, 2019 \r\n\n**Temporal resolution:** yearly \r\n\n**Geographic Extent:** Siberia (Northern Siberia region), Amazonia (Eastern Amazonas region), Africa (Eastern Sahel region) \r\n\n**Spatial Resolution:** 30m \r\n\n**Version:** 1.2 \r\n\r\n[ESA High Resolution Land Cover Climate Change Initiative Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/high-resolution-land-cover/)  \r\n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/b057708eec1042238fb333ab02ec772e)\r\n\r\n\n**Detailed Legend:** \r\n<style>\r\n .dot {\r\n height: 10px;\r\n width: 10px;\r\n border-radius: 50%;\r\n display: inline-block;\r\n margin-right: 5px;\r\n vertical-align: middle;\r\n }\r\n</style>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"></div>No data<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(10, 0, 100);\"></div>Tree cover evergreen broadleaf<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(20, 0, 60);\"></div>Tree cover evergreen needleleaf<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(30 0 160);\"></div>Tree cover deciduous broadleaf<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(40, 40, 80);\"></div>Tree cover deciduous needleleaf<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(50, 150, 100);\"></div>Shrub cover evergreen<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(60 170 115);\"></div>Shrub cover deciduous<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(70, 255, 180);\"></div>Grasslands<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(80, 255, 255);\"></div>Croplands<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(90, 27, 203);\"></div>Woody vegetation acquatic or regularly flooded<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(100, 0, 220);\"></div>Grassland vegetation acquatic or regularly flooded<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(110, 255, 220);\"></div>Lichens and mosses<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(120, 255, 245);\"></div>Bare areas<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(130, 195, 20);\"></div>Built-up<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(140, 0, 70);\"></div>Open water<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(142, 0, 70);\"></div>Open water permanent<br>\r\n<div class=\"dot\" style=\"background: rgb(150, 255, 255);\"></div>Permanent snow and/or ice<br>"
