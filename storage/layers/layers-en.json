    "description": "Throughout history, humans have used fire as an environmental management tool. Vegetation characteristics, mainly biomass loads and moisture, determine fire behaviour, but fire also modifies vegetation structure and evolution. Climate affects fire occurrence through the thermal and precipitation cycles, but it is also affected by fire, particularly through emissions of gases and particulate matter. This mutual influence between vegetation, climate and fire highlights the importance of having global long-term information on burned area (BA) as an input for climate and vegetation modellers.\n\nCurrently, the  CCI Fire  product includes 19 years of global burned area data. The product is offered at 250m resolution with date of fire detection and the land cover type that was burned, and at  quarter-degree cells with total BA per grid cell,  total BA per land cover type, and observed area. In both cases, uncertainty layers are also provided.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Total Burned Area in Square Meters  \n\n**Time Span:** January 2001 – December 2020  \n\n**Temporal Resolution:** monthly  \n\n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n\n**Spatial Resolution:**  0.25 x 0.25 degree  \n\n**Version:** 5.1  \n\n**DOI:**  [10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)  \n\n[ESA CCI Fire ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/fire/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)"

One of the most noticeable changes occurs in the Arctic region, where receding sea ice gives more open water over which wind generates waves.

LSWT gives insight into which lakes are vulnerable to shifts of behaviour that could undermine their biodiversity or amenity.\n\nThe CCI project has created timeseries of LSWT from 1995 onwards, on a regular grid of latitude-longitude.
