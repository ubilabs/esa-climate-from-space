    "description": "Throughout history, humans have used fire as an environmental management tool. Vegetation characteristics, mainly biomass loads and moisture, determine fire behaviour, but fire also modifies vegetation structure and evolution. Climate affects fire occurrence through the thermal and precipitation cycles, but it is also affected by fire, particularly by gaseous and PM emissions. This mutual influences among vegetation, climate and fire highlight the importance of having global long-term burned area (BA) information that serves as input for climate and vegetation modellers.\nCurrently, the FireCCI51 BA product includes 19 years of global BA data. The product is offered at 250m resolution with date of detection and land cover burned, and at 0.25 degree cells with total BA per grid cell,  total BA per land cover, and observed area. In both cases, uncertainty layers are also incorporated.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Total Burned Area in Square Meters  \n\n**Time Span:** January 2001 – December 2019  \n\n**Temporal Resolution:** monthly  \n\n**Geographic Extent:** global  \n\n**Spatial Resolution:**  0.25 x 0.25 degree  \n\n**Version:** 5.1  \n\n**DOI:**  [10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)  \n\n[ESA CCI Fire ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/fire/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3628cb2fdba443588155e15dee8e5352)"

It favours the occurrence of floods and droughts and is therefore essential for monitoring and predicting their impact on the environment.\n\nIn CCI a long-term (~40 year long) record is created by merging multiple active (radar) and passive (radiometer) sensor based satellite SM data sets into three harmonised, daily products. The current version contains quality checked data from 1978 to 2019 from 11 different sensors. Unreliable observations - as e.g. under frozen soil conditions - are masked out in the data.

SM anomalies separate recurring seasonal/climatological variations from varying regional conditions and represent these deviations from the average conditions at each point in time. Droughts are therefore represented as negative anomalies while positive anomalies indicate “wetter than normal” conditions.\n\nIn CCI SM anomalies are calculated as differences between absolute SM observations and the SM climatology from a 20 year baseline period (1991-2010).

Global maps of sea-surface salinity are particularly helpful for studying the water cycle, ocean–atmosphere exchanges and ocean circulation, which are all vital components of the climate system transporting heat, momentum, carbon and nutrients around the globe.\n\nIn CCI, a global record of SSS covering the period 2010-2019 has been processed from SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP SSS. In addition to SSS, indicators for SSS uncertainties are provided. This new data set allows to monitor 2 El Niño and La Niña events of very different intensities.\n\n**Variable shown:** Sea Surface Salinity \n\n**Time Span:** 2010-2019 \n\n**Temporal resolution:** monthly (temporal sampling: 2 weeks) \n\n**Spatial resolution:** 50km (spatial sampling: 25km) \n\n**Geographical extent:** global \n\n**Version:** 2.31 \n\n**DOI:** [doi:10.5285/4ce685bff631459fb2a30faa699f3fc5](https://dx.doi.org/10.5285/4ce685bff631459fb2a30faa699f3fc5)\n\n[ESA CCI Sea Surface Salinity ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/projects/sea-state/) \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/7813eb75a131474a8d908f69c716b031)"

The rate of increase would be twice as much if “natural sinks” - such as the oceans and the land biosphere - did not take up about 50% of all the CO₂ emitted by us each year.  \nHowever, it is not clear how these natural sinks will behave in the future. A good understanding of the CO₂ sources and sinks is important to reliably predict the future climate of our planet.

    "description": "Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is the temperature of the surface lake waters as seen from space in infrared wavelengths. LSWT can be derived when the lake surface water is not obscured by ice cover or clouds. Lakes cover less than 1% of Earth’s land area, but lakes and their shores contribute disproportionately to biodiversity and human flourishing. Obvious features in the LSWT are the large annual cycle in temperature in higher latitudes, and the important patterns of temperature contrast across individual lakes, especially large ones. Lakes and the ecosystems they support interact sensitively with climate, and LSWT gives insight into which lakes are vulnerable to shifts of behaviour that could undermine their biodiversity or amenity.\n\nThe CCI project has created timeseries of LSWT from 1995 onwards, on a regular grid of latitude-longitude. This has involved combining observations from four satellite missions and 250 lakes were targeted. Future versions of the dataset will increase the density of available observations by bringing in more satellite missions, and will target thousands of lakes.\n\n**Variable Shown:** Lake Surface Water Temperature  \n\n**Time Span:**  June 1995 – December 2019\n\n**Temporal Resolution:**  monthly\n\n**Geographic Extent:** global \n\n**Version:** v1.0\n\n**DOI:** [10.5285/3c324bb4ee394d0d876fe2e1db217378](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/3c324bb4ee394d0d876fe2e1db217378)  \n\n[ESA CCI Lakes ECV Project website](https://climate.esa.int/de/projekte/lakes/)  \n[Data in the Open Data Portal](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3c324bb4ee394d0d876fe2e1db217378)"
