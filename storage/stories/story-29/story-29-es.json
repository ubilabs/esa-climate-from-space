Their home, the savannah, is slowly changing as droughts become more frequent and intense. The Samburu are semi-nomadic, travelling around with their livestock, which consists mostly of cattle, sheep and goats. When the local vegetation is no longer sufficient to feed their herds they relocate to a greener place, giving the land time to recover. \r\n\r\nBut nowadays a greener place can be hard to find. With global warming, droughts in Kenya are becoming more common and rivers that usually flow during the rainy season can be dry for the whole year. Drought means spending longer searching for water and grass. Over time, the livestock can become weaker, fall ill or die. As it gets harder to make a living, more young people move to towns and cities in search of work. As cities and commercial farms expand, less land and water is left for nomadic herders. \r\n\r\nA similar story is playing out in many places across the world. In Nigeria, crop farmers and cattle herders each play their part in feeding a growing urban population. In the past there was room for both, but recent years have seen disputes between the two communities as climate change puts their land under stress.",

Small, scattered groups of people could survive by moving with the animals they hunted and eating the plants they gathered. But, even in good years, an ecosystem can support only a limited number of people living in this way. \r\n\r\nThe domestication of plants and animals enabled settlements to expand into towns and cities. While agriculture has allowed populations to expand, growing populations have, in turn, meant we have had to find ways of producing more – and more nutritious – food. For over 10,000 years, how we produce our food has shaped the landscape and changed the evolutionary paths of many species. We now know that it also influences Earth’s climate.\r\n\r\n## Zero Hunger\r\n\r\nWith the global population now at 7.7 billion people, and expected to approach 10 billion by 2050, how we produce enough food, and whether we can do it in a secure and sustainable way, are among the most important questions facing humanity. ‘Zero Hunger’ is the second of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals.",

From the vantage point of space we can see that plants in some regions are far more productive than others. By seeing how productivity changes through the growing season we can identify and map different types of land cover. Year-to-year comparison allows us to track changes across the globe. \r\n\r\nChanging how we use the land not only affects the plants that grow on it, but also the movement of carbon, nutrients and water. It is estimated that 70 per cent of the fresh water we use goes to support agriculture. \r\n\r\nBut changing how we use the land  also affects the climate. The clearing of tropical forests for agriculture releases the carbon stored in wood and soil, as well as weakening one of the world’s major carbon sinks. About a quarter of human greenhouse gas emissions arise directly from agriculture and forestry, and this figure rises to a third when the entire food supply chain is included.",

So how will climate change affect agricultural productivity? As the planet warms we can expect some temperate areas, such as the Canadian prairies, to become more productive, while areas closer to the Equator will struggle with more frequent droughts and become unsuitable for agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn many places, we already try to increase productivity by managing the water supply (through irrigation, for example), the light level (using artificial lighting, or intercropping low-level crops with trees) or the temperature (using greenhouses, polytunnels and mulches). \r\n\r\nMore atmospheric carbon dioxide may boost productivity, but only where there are enough soil nutrients available to sustain growth. Adding nutrients in the form of natural or artificial fertilisers may help improve yields where plants would otherwise struggle to thrive, and some commercial tomato growers even pump extra carbon dioxide into their greenhouses. But most of these solutions cannot be used sustainably over large areas – and many cause problems of their own. Toxic algae blooms can grow when excess fertiliser runs off into nearby water bodies, and the nutritional value of plants can fall if carbon dioxide levels rise too high.",

As the climate warms, more frequent extreme weather events are expected to result in more crop failures and make some farmlands unsuitable for agriculture. \r\n\r\nIn today’s interconnected world, the impact of a harvest failure can be far-reaching. Food shortages can be followed by civil unrest and even conflict. In 2010, drought in Russia, Ukraine and Argentina coincided with severe storms in Canada and Australia. All these countries are major wheat producers. The Russian harvest was down by a quarter, exports were stopped, and a worldwide grain shortage hit countries reliant on food imports the hardest. \r\n\r\nHigh food prices contributed to the civil unrest that swept across North Africa and the Middle East during the ‘Arab Spring’ of 2010-11.
