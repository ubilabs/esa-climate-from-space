Forest loss in this dataset is defined as a change from a forest to non-forest state for every pixel of the dataset. The forest loss data, from the University of Maryland, has been overlaid onto the 2020 above ground biomass dataset, generated by ESA’s Climate Change Initiative. As visible in the second sequence, rainforests worldwide are being destroyed at an alarming rate. The conversion of tropical rainforests to pastures and croplands is causing a dramatic effect on the landscape, biodiversity and environment. This is of great concern as rainforests play an important role in our global climate. It is estimated that 20% of the Amazon biome has already been lost and the trend will worsen if gone unchecked. \r\n\r\nCredits: ESA (data sources: CCI Biomass project and Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA).
