      "text": "# How Low Can You Go? \r\n\r\nIn 1979, engineers received the first data from a new instrument on an American research satellite. The sensor measured so little ozone in the atmosphere over Antarctica that the readings were discounted as instrument error. But not long afterwards, a team of British researchers recorded similarly low amounts of ozone from their Antarctic research station. \r\n\r\nIt was only when the ground-based results were published in the scientific literature that the low values in the satellite data were taken seriously. They showed a wide area with very low amounts of ozone developing every spring over the South Pole. This ‘hole’ in Earth’s protective ozone layer quickly gained the attention of the media and policy-makers. And, with their data verified, scientists gained confidence in the emerging technology of Earth observation from space.\r\n\r\n## Protective Layer \r\n\r\nThe layer of ozone high up in the stratosphere is our main defence against the Sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Without it we’d suffer sunburn after a few minutes outdoors, followed by eye damage and skin cancer after prolonged exposure. Unfiltered, UV light would have a catastrophic effect on all life on Earth.    \r\n\r\n![The Sun in visible and UV light](assets/story8_02.png) \r\n_The Sun in visible (left) and ultraviolet light (right), as viewed by the SOHO satellite on February 3, 2002. (ESA/NASA)_\r\n\r\nOzone is also a powerful greenhouse gas. Change in the distribution of ozone is the second largest human impact on the climate, after the increase in carbon dioxide. But, while ozone _loss_ has been the concern in the stratosphere, ozone has been _increasing_ at ground level. Here, ozone associated with transport and industrial pollution is a hazard to human health. Whether ozone is good or bad for you depends on where you find it.",

      "text": "# Ozone Depletion \r\n\r\nAtmospheric sampling from balloons and aircraft identified the causes of ozone depletion as man-made gases, particularly the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used as a propellant in aerosol sprays, fire extinguishers and pesticides, and as a coolant in refrigerators and air conditioners. Most of these gases are harmless for human beings, but once they reach the stratosphere they are hit by solar radiation that changes their molecular structure, releasing atoms of chlorine. \r\n\r\n![Sources of stratospheric chlorine graph](assets/story8_01.png) \r\n_Sources of stratospheric chlorine._\r\n\r\nA single atom of chlorine can split apart a large number of ozone molecules. Although ozone depletion is a global process, atmospheric conditions including extremely low temperatures, stratospheric cloud formation and the polar vortex concentrate it in the springtime in the polar regions, particularly over Antarctica. \r\n\r\n![Chlorine in ozone depletion diagram](assets/ozone_large_03a.png) \r\n_The role of chlorine in ozone depletion._\r\n\r\nIn 1987 severe limits on CFC emissions were agreed at an intergovernmental conference in Montreal. The wide adoption of the Montreal Protocol and the identification of safer alternatives means that CFCs have largely been phased out of use, and the ozone layer is slowly recovering. It is a good example of international cooperation to address a threat to the global environment. But CFCs have a very long lifetime in the atmosphere, and stratospheric ozone is not expected to return to 1980 levels until 2030-2060.",

      "text": "# Ozone and Climate \r\n\r\nOzone and the climate are closely connected since ozone is a powerful greenhouse gas. By absorbing ultraviolet radiation it warms the surrounding atmosphere, so ozone loss has cooled the stratosphere. This can influence atmospheric circulation patterns, such as shifting the position of the jet stream. Beneath the ozone hole, stronger winds blowing off Antarctica may be partly responsible for the observed increase in Southern Ocean sea ice. \r\n\r\nBut stratospheric ozone depletion lets more solar energy through to the troposphere below. Here, ground-level ozone and other greenhouse gases absorb that energy. So ozone changes are pulling the temperature in opposite directions in the stratosphere and the troposphere. The overall effect has been a warming of the atmosphere.",

Here it is formed when light interacts with combustion by-products from cars and industry, mainly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). At ground level, ozone is harmful to human health, causing breathing difficulties that contribute to about half a million premature deaths every year. It also has a detrimental impact on vegetation growth, reducing its ability to absorb carbon dioxide, leading to crop losses valued at tens of billions of euros per year.\r\n\r\nAs with stratospheric ozone, regulations have been introduced to limit the damage. Newly-manufactured vehicles must meet internationally-agreed emission controls. The use of unleaded petrol and catalytic converters has removed a lot of the ozone-forming pollutants from car exhausts over recent decades. Similar technology is applied to factory and power station smokestacks, while simpler steps like planting trees in urban areas can also help soak up ground-level ozone.",

They allow us to monitor the recovery of the ozone layer and calculate a UV exposure index as part of our daily weather forecasts. They also deepen our knowledge of the long-term evolution of atmospheric ozone and our understanding of how it affects the climate, and how it might respond to climate change. \r\n\r\nDifferent observation techniques allow us to distinguish between the “good” ozone in the stratosphere and the “bad” ozone in the troposphere. Satellites looking straight down produce maps of *total ozone* – the total amount of ozone in a column going from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. Total ozone is a good measure of stratospheric ozone, which accounts for about 90% of the total ozone column.  \r\n\r\n![Ozone profile](assets/ozone_large_15.jpg) \r\n_Ozone profiles show the vertical distribution of ozone through the atmosphere._\r\n\r\nBy looking sideways into the atmosphere, satellites can also measure the *ozone profile* – the vertical distribution of ozone from sea level up to about 50 km high. Further information is obtained by seeing how light is absorbed by different chemicals in the atmosphere when looking towards a light source – the Sun or the Moon.",

Each space-borne sensor has its own radiometric characteristics, spatial resolution and coverage, making the harmonisation and merging of the data a complex task. The resulting integrated datasets have the advantage of providing better spatial coverage than those from individual sensors, and allow time series to exceed the life of a single instrument, giving the long-term trends so crucial for climate studies. They have enabled a better understanding of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the distribution of atmospheric ozone and improved our understanding of ozone processes in climate models.  \r\n\r\n![Ozone sensors](assets/ozone_large_09.png) \r\n_Satellites and sensors used by the CCI Ozone team. (update – extend time lines?)_\r\n\r\nJust as individuals can use daily UV and air quality warnings based on satellite data to protect their own health and that of their children, scientists are using the same observations from space to track the effect of ozone on the climate, so that political leaders have the information they need to make decisions and take action to protect us all. Emission controls will continue to reduce ozone destruction in the stratosphere and limit ozone creation in the troposphere, and provide successful examples of international cooperation to solve an environmental problem.",
