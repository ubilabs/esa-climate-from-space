It can form stable chemical bonds with many elements, allowing large and complex molecules to be built, including the organic compounds essential to life. Carbon’s bonds to other elements are stable, but not so strong that they prevent chemical reaction. \r\n\r\nAs it reacts with other elements, carbon cycles through the atmosphere, the oceans, plants and animals, soil and rocks. There are exchanges between these carbon reservoirs through a variety of processes. When carbon bonds are broken, energy is released, making some carbon compounds – hydrocarbons – convenient fuel sources. \r\n \r\n## Greenhouse Gases \r\n\r\nBut the same bonds that make carbon molecules so essential to life and modern living have a downside. They are also good at absorbing long-wavelength infrared radiation, allowing the molecules to vibrate and warm up, trapping heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. \r\n\r\nCarbon compounds such as carbon dioxide and methane are not the only greenhouse gases, nor the most powerful, but our increased burning of fossil fuels – coal, oil and natural gas – has caused an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, disrupting the carbon cycle, and warming the Earth’s climate.",

        "The molecular structure of carbon dioxide and methane molecules allows them to absorb infrared radiation. Heat is absorbed by a molecule if the atoms inside can vibrate at the frequency of infrared radiation. More complex molecules have more vibrational modes, so more opportunities to absorb heat, making them more powerful greenhouse gases. A methane molecule, with one carbon atom (grey) bound to four hydrogen atoms (red), can absorb more heat than a carbon dioxide molecule, with one carbon atom bound to two oxygen atoms (blue). A chlorofluorocarbon like CFC-113 (green and yellow) has even more bonds, making it a very powerful greenhouse gas. (Planetary Visions)",

      "text": "## The Fast Carbon Cycle\r\n\r\nPlants take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis as they grow in spring and summer, and return some of it when their leaves die back in autumn and winter. Carbon is also returned to the atmosphere by animals eating plants and breathing out carbon dioxide. The cycling of carbon through living things is known as the fast carbon cycle.\r\n\r\nThis seasonal growth cycle can be seen in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels shown on the interactive globe: a peak is reached at the end of the northern winter, before rapidly-growing plants start absorbing carbon dioxide again in the spring. Atmospheric carbon varies most in the northern hemisphere because it has more land, and therefore more plants, than the southern hemisphere. On top of the seasonal cycle there is a clear increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from year to year – a sign that the carbon cycle is out of balance, mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels.\r\n \r\n## Carbon and the Land \r\n\r\n[Changes in land use and land cover](stories/story-28/3) are also altering the carbon cycle. The clearing of tropical forests for agriculture has the double effect of adding large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from fires, while also removing the trees that absorb and store carbon while they are alive. \r\n\r\nAround the Arctic, elevated air temperatures are thawing out large areas of [permafrost](stories/story-15/5).  This exposes carbon in the soil to decomposition and could potentially release into the atmosphere vast amounts of methane. As northern latitudes thaw and dry out, vast areas of forest, bush and peat are newly exposed to the risk of [wildfires](stories/story-28/1). Fire is a key component of the carbon cycle, taking carbon from the biosphere into the atmosphere.",

Carbon dioxide is dissolved in sea water but also [absorbed by ocean plants](stories/story-31/3) – phytoplankton – which use chlorophyll to perform photosynthesis in the same way as plants on land. Some carbon dioxide is quickly released back to the atmosphere, so the oceans play a part in the fast carbon cycle, but some is mixed into the deep ocean, where it stays for centuries as part of the slow carbon cycle. \r\n\r\nOceanic lifeforms from phytoplankton to coral, crustaceans and whales absorb carbon as they grow and take some of it to the sea floor when they die. Here, carbon is locked up in sedimentary rock, Earth’s largest carbon store. Under certain conditions layers of organic carbon can build up into fossil fuel deposits – coal, oil or natural gas. \r\n\r\nThe slow cycle eventually returns carbon to the atmosphere through geological processes. Carbon dioxide is expelled from rocks under extreme heat and pressure and vented to the atmosphere in volcanic eruptions. From the atmosphere, carbon can return to the surface dissolved in rainwater as weak carbonic acid, where it plays a role in the chemical weathering of rocks and the delivery of minerals and salts to the sea.",
