Although the sun is at its highest point in the sky and there are more hours of sunlight than on any other day of the year, the sea does not reach its maximum temperature until two or three months later. This lag shows that the sea has a high heat capacity – it takes a lot of energy to change its temperature, so it is slow to heat up and slow to cool down.\r\n \r\nThis makes the sea incredibly good at storing heat. So good, that just the top three metres of the ocean contains as much heat as the entire atmosphere. The ocean’s capacity to accumulate, transport and slowly release the energy it receives from the Sun is one of the key regulators of weather and climate on our planet.",

In the western Mediterranean, warmer sea water is a key factor in the sudden rainstorms and flash floods that afflict the coasts of France, Italy and Spain in late summer.\r\n\r\nOn a larger scale, high water temperatures in tropical oceans power extreme weather events such as hurricanes. The energy exchange between ocean and atmosphere during these events is revealed by a dip in the sea surface temperature in the wake of large hurricanes. \r\n\r\n## Climate Indicators\r\nWhile the atmosphere can quickly move energy around the planet in weather systems, the ocean’s much greater capacity to store heat makes it a more stable indicator of longer-term climate trends. The rise in global average air temperature slowed down in the first decade of this century, causing some to question global warming, but the slowdown has proved temporary, with air temperature rising quickly again since 2012.

Maps of sea surface temperature (SST) show not only warm and cold currents, but also where deep cold water is upwelling to the surface, bringing with it the nutrients that support the world’s largest fisheries. Modern fishing fleets use SST maps from satellites to help find and follow fish on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nThe data viewer on the right shows a comparison between SST and ocean chlorophyll, a measure of the abundance of phytoplankton derived from the colour of the ocean. High chlorophyll concentrations are associated with areas of cold water upwelling off the coasts of Peru, Argentina and Namibia. Cold, deep water rises when the surface water is pushed offshore by prevailing winds, bringing with it nutrients on which the plankton thrive. \r\n\r\nThe same plankton that are the base of the oceanic food chain – phytoplankton – also play a key role in the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, just as plants do on land.

      "text": "## The Ocean’s Ups and Downs\r\n\r\nWhile upwelling is often driven by surface winds, the sinking of water into the deep ocean is largely driven by temperature and salinity, which control the density of the water. Where the North Atlantic meets cold Arctic air masses, the ocean is rapidly cooled and the formation of sea ice leaves an excess of salt behind in the water. Similar processes are at work in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.\r\n\r\nThe interactive globe on the right shows the salinity of the ocean’s surface. Low salinity values can be seen where major rivers discharge freshwater into the ocean. The highest values show where salt is left behind in the ocean during evaporation – in the almost enclosed Mediterranean and Red Seas – or during sea ice formation, such as in the Greenland Sea.\r\n\r\nWhere sea ice forms the combination of low temperature and high salinity makes the surface water very dense, so it sinks, embarking on a thousand-year journey into the deep ocean and around the world as part of the ‘Great Ocean Conveyor Belt’, more formally known as the thermohaline circulation. The sinking of water off Norway and Greenland helps pull the North Atlantic Drift and Gulf Stream currents, with their warm tropical water, towards the pole. The thermohaline circulation is a key component of the global climate system. \r\n\r\n## Heat Sink\r\nThe connection between the ocean surface and the large mass of the deep ocean provided by the thermohaline circulation, together with the vertical motion of waves and tides, has helped the ocean absorb more than 90% of the excess heat built up over the last 50 years of global warming. This heat is penetrating deeper into the ocean, which has spared most of us from the full effects of our greenhouse gas emissions. But there is no guarantee that the ocean will continue to absorb heat at this rate.",

As the warm water builds up so does cloud cover, due to the increased evaporation of sea water. \r\n\r\n## La Niña\r\nWhen El Niño ends, the cold water sometimes returns stronger than ever, clearing a gap in the clouds as the local climate enters its cool phase – La Niña. These changes to ocean temperature and evaporation over the Pacific lead to changes in rainfall trends across the world.
