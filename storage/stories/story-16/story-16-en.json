Although the sun is at its highest point in the sky and there are more hours of sunlight than on any other day of the year, the sea does not reach its maximum temperature until two or three months later. This lag shows that the sea has a high heat capacity – it takes a lot of energy to change its temperature, so it is slow to heat up and slow to cool down.\r\n \r\nThis makes the sea incredibly good at storing heat. So good, that just the top three metres of the ocean contain as much heat as the entire atmosphere. The ocean’s ability to accumulate, transport and slowly release the energy it receives from the Sun is one of the key regulators of weather and climate on our planet.",

This makes the sea an important regulator of the climate, and the temperature of its surface a key measurement for climate scientists.\r\n\r\nHigher sea surface temperatures lead to more evaporation. More water vapour in the atmosphere potentially means more clouds and more rain. Warmer water in the western Mediterranean is a key factor in the sudden rainstorms and flash floods that afflict the coasts of France, Italy and Spain in late summer.\r\n\r\nOn a larger scale, high temperatures in tropical oceans power extreme weather events such as hurricanes. The energy exchange between ocean and atmosphere during these events is shown by a dip in the sea surface temperature in the wake of large hurricanes.  \r\n\r\n## Climate Indicators\r\nIn 2020 forecasters reached the end of the alphabet when naming Atlantic storms and had to resort to Greek letters for only the second time (the first was 2005). While it is not clear that there will be more hurricanes in a warming world, there is evidence that storms are becoming more powerful, so we are likely to see more of the most damaging Category 4 and 5 hurricanes.\r\n\r\nWhile atmospheric weather systems can quickly move energy around the planet, the ocean’s much greater heat capacity makes it a better indicator of longer-term climate trends. The rise in global average air temperature slowed down in the first decade of this century, causing some to question global warming. But the slowdown has proved temporary and air temperatures have risen quickly again since 2012. The temperature of the oceans continued to rise throughout.",

      "text": "## Fisherman’s Friend\r\n\r\nSatellites using infrared cameras can measure the ocean temperature to within a few tenths of a degree Celsius. Maps of sea surface temperature (SST) show not only warm and cold currents, but also where cold water from the deep ocean is upwelling to the surface, bringing with it the nutrients that support the world’s largest fisheries. Other cameras can record the colour of the ocean, revealing the chlorophyll present in tiny floating plants called phytoplankton. \r\n\r\nThe interactive globes allow you to compare SST and ocean chlorophyll. There are high chlorophyll concentrations off the coasts of Peru, Argentina and Namibia. In these areas, prevailing winds push the surface water offshore and cold, deep water rises to replace it, bringing to the surface the nutrients on which the plankton thrive. \r\n\r\nSince phytoplankton are at the base of many oceanic food chains, there are generally many fish and other sea creatures in areas rich in plankton. Modern fishing fleets, therefore, use SST maps from satellites to help find and follow fish on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nPhytoplankton also play a key role in the climate, since they use chlorophyll to absorb carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, just as plants do on land. So ocean colour is also a key climate variable.",

      "text": "## The Ocean’s Ups and Downs\r\n\r\nWhile upwelling is often driven by surface winds, the sinking of water into the deep ocean is largely driven by temperature and salinity, which control the density of the water. Where the North Atlantic meets cold Arctic air masses, the ocean is rapidly cooled and the formation of sea ice leaves excess salt in the water. Cooler, saltier water is more dense and will sink. Similar processes are at work around Antarctica in the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe interactive globe shows the salinity of the ocean’s surface. It is low where major rivers discharge freshwater into the ocean. The highest values show where salt is left behind during evaporation – in the almost enclosed Mediterranean and Red Seas – or during sea ice formation, such as in the Greenland Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen the very dense water created where sea ice forms sinks, it embarks on a thousand-year journey into the deep ocean and around the world as part of the ‘Great Ocean Conveyor Belt’, more formally known as the thermohaline circulation. Descending water off Norway and Greenland helps pull the North Atlantic Drift and Gulf Stream currents, with their warm tropical water, towards the North pole. The thermohaline circulation is a key component of the global climate system. \r\n\r\n## Heat Sink\r\nThe connection between the ocean surface and the large mass of the deep ocean provided by the thermohaline circulation, together with the vertical motion of waves and tides, has helped the ocean absorb more than 90% of the excess heat built up over the last 50 years of global warming, sparing most of us from the full effects of our greenhouse gas emissions. But, as this heat penetrates deeper waters, there is no guarantee that the ocean will continue to absorb heat at this rate.",

Such disturbances include the Indian Ocean Dipole and the North Atlantic Oscillation, but the most well-known are El Niño and La Niña. These are the warm and cool phases of a recurring climate cycle across the tropical Pacific – the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO.\r\n\r\n## El Niño\r\nDuring El Niño, the east-to-west trade winds across the equatorial Pacific weaken. This causes a build-up of warm water in the eastern Pacific and supresses the upwelling of cold water. As the warm water builds up the increased evaporation of sea water leads to an increase in cloud cover, which can leave Asia, Australia and even Africa experiencing very dry years. \r\n\r\n## La Niña\r\nWhen El Niño ends, the cold water sometimes returns stronger than ever, clearing a gap in the clouds as the local climate enters its cool phase – La Niña. These changes to ocean temperature and evaporation over the Pacific lead to changes in rainfall trends across the world. Certain regions can become wetter or drier than normal, which can lead to more flash floods, droughts or wild fires.",
