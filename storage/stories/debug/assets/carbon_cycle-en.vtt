00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.100
The Carbon Cycle

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.880
Carbon is one of the most
abundant elements in the Universe.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.900
On Earth, carbon is stored in the oceans,
in rocks and plants, and in the atmosphere.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.400
There are exchanges between these carbon
reservoirs through a variety of processes,

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.400
some of which can be observed by satellites.

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.400
<i>Vegetation Index</i>

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.700
Plants take up carbon from the atmosphere
by photosynthesis as they grow,

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
and return some of it when they die back.

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.500
<i>Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide</i>

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.500
The seasonal growth cycle can be seen
in atmospheric carbon observations.

11
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.400
<i>Fire Burned Area</i>

12
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.000
Changes to vegetation, such as fires
or deforestation, can release

13
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900
carbon back into the atmosphere and reduce
the biosphere’s capacity to store carbon.

14
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.900
<i>Carbon Dioxide Concentration</i>

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.200
Atmospheric carbon varies most in the
northern hemisphere because it has more land,

16
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.900
and therefore more plants,
than the southern hemisphere.

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.900
<i>Carbon Dioxide Ocean Flux</i>
<i>absorption / emission</i>

18
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.700
Carbon dioxide is absorbed by
water at the sea surface,

19
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.700
allowing the exchange of carbon
between the atmosphere and the ocean.

20
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.300
Some carbon dioxide is quickly released
back to the atmosphere,

21
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.900
but some is mixed into the deep ocean,
where it stays for centuries.

22
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.900
<i>Chlorophyll Concentration</i>

23
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.800
Oceanic organisms, including phytoplankton,
absorb carbon as they grow

24
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.400
and take some of it to the
sea floor when they die.

25
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
Here, carbon is locked up
in ocean sedimentary rock,

26
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.500
Earth’s largest carbon store.

27
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.000
Human activity, primarily
the burning of fossil fuel,

28
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.400
has increased the amount of
carbon in the atmosphere.

29
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.000
Since 1970, carbon dioxide emissions
have increased by 90%.

30
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.300
Some of the excess carbon dioxide has been
absorbed by the land and the ocean,

31
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.600
but the net accumulation of atmospheric
carbon is changing the climate.

<i>Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide</i>

33
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.500
<i>Global Monthly Average</i>

34
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:49.000
Daily atmospheric carbon dioxide reached 400ppm in
2013 and has remained above this level since 2016.

35
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.300
ESA’s Climate Change Initiative is using
Earth observation data to advance

36
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.920
our understanding of the carbon cycle
and its role in climate change.
