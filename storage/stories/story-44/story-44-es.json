The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 threw a huge volume of aerosols high into the atmosphere, where they reflected a significant amount of solar energy, lowering temperatures around the world for a few years. \r\n\r\n## El Niño Southern Oscillation\r\n[El Niño and La Niña events](stories/story16/6) change the temperature of a large part of the central Pacific Ocean, and so significantly affect the global average SST, as shown in the SST plot. \r\n\r\n## Earth Energy Accumulation\r\nSatellites have measured that the energy coming in from the Sun exceeds the energy going out from Earth. It is this energy imbalance that drives global warming. Over the last 40 years, it is estimated that each square metre of Earth’s surface has accumulated about 1 gigajoule of energy – enough to boil 4,500 kettles of water.\r\n\r\nBy quantifying the individual drivers of ocean warming, seasonal and interannual variability can be separated from long-term trends. Adding the drivers together gives a good fit to the observed SST changes across the satellite record. \r\n\r\nEarth energy accumulation is found to be the most important driver of the long-term temperature increase, and explains the observed acceleration of ocean warming over the past four decades. This is consistent with reported accelerations in the storage of heat in the ocean and sea level rise.",
