      "text": "# A Passage Opens\n\nFor centuries, the Northwest Passage between mainland Canada and its Arctic islands has held promise as a shorter sea route between Europe and Asia. But for most of this time it has proved an impenetrable barrier, locked fast in the grip of a frozen sea.\n\t\nThe pack ice defeated the Royal Navy in 1845 when Sir John Franklin’s expedition was lost. Eighteen search parties over the next thirty years failed to find any trace of him and his 130 crewmen. It wasn’t until 1906 that Roald Amundsen became the first to complete a route through the Northwest Passage, after a journey lasting three years.\n\nA century later, still only a handful of voyages had picked their way through the icy waters, some with the aid of icebreakers. Then in the summer of 2007, satellite images showed, for the first time on record, the entire Passage to be largely ice-free. This surprised climate scientists, whose models predicted it would remain ice-bound for some decades to come. Today, you can book a cruise through the Northwest Passage on a liner with more than a thousand other passengers.\n\nFranklin’s ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, were found by Canadian seafloor surveys in 2014 and 2016, solving at least part of the 170 year-old mystery surrounding the expedition’s disappearance.\n\n",

      "text": "# New Trade Routes\n\nThe loss of Arctic sea ice has been faster than was predicted, with the southern route of the Northwest Passage now navigable almost every year. The more direct, and commercially significant, northern route has opened during six of the last ten summers. In 2008, the first commercial ship passed through and in 2013 the first bulk carrier took cargo from Vancouver to Helsinki. \n\nThe shrinking icepack is also opening up to shipping the northern coast of Russia – the Northeast Passage. This route shaves more than one third off the sailing distance from Yokohama to Hamburg, compared with the current shortest route through the Suez Canal. There is even greater potential for savings in distance, time and fuel if the ice recedes enough for navigation across the centre of the Arctic Ocean – the Transpolar Sea Route.\n\nShorter shipping routes will mean less fuel is burned, and less carbon pumped into the atmosphere, but the Arctic will see a local increase in pollutants. Soot particles could darken the remaining ice, adding to the warming, but could also cause more clouds to condense, which might have a cooling effect.\n\nAlthough good news for the shipping and tourism industries, the retreat of the ice edge is a stark warning that the Earth’s climate is rapidly heading into uncharted waters. \n",

In the Arctic, the thickness data is incomplete, with a gap around the pole due to the orbital configuration of the satellites (Envisat and CryoSat), and because measuring thin ice (below about 1 metre) is difficult for these satellites. *\n\nThe Arctic Ocean is characterised by the sea ice cover and its seasonal fluctuations. During winter, the ice pack grows to an area between 14 and 16 million square kilometres, reducing to four to five million square kilometres by the end of summer. That’s an area equivalent to the entire surface of Europe appearing and disappearing through the year. The core of the ice cover is formed of layers of frozen seawater that have survived the summer thaw. This multi-year ice reaches a thickness of two to four metres, whereas first-year sea ice typically reaches only 1 – 1.5 metres.\n\n## Long-term trend\n\n![Sea ice minimum graph](assets/story15_04.png)\n_Arctic sea ice extent in August 1979-2019_\n\nSatellite observations show a significant loss of Arctic sea ice in recent decades, with the lowest extents observed in 2012, followed by 2007 and 2019. Since the advent of regular satellite measurements of sea ice in 1978, the Arctic Ocean’s summer sea ice extent has reduced by almost 40%. In the Southern Ocean the mean ice extent around Antarctica has increased 4-6% in the same period, but globally the trend is down and the loss is accelerating.\n",

Sea ice insulates the sea, reducing heat loss to the atmosphere and providing a barrier to the exchange of gases and momentum. But bright ice also reflects sunlight that would be absorbed by dark ocean water. So, in a warming climate sea ice is subject to a positive feedback: melting ice exposes darker ocean water, which warms up, leading to further melting. \n\n![Sea ice reflectance](assets/story15_05.jpg)\n_Melting of sea ice dramatically changes the energy balance in the Arctic Ocean_\n\nThis is part of a process called the Arctic amplification. More heat is also being transported to the poles by both the atmosphere and the ocean as they warm up. This makes the Arctic one of the most sensitive regions to variations in global climate, and the place where most climate models predict the greatest warming.  Observed temperature rise in the Arctic has been 2-3 times the global average. ",

      "text": "# Climate Regulator\n\nSea ice has an important influence on the global ocean circulation. When seawater freezes in the winter, it leaves salt behind, increasing the salinity and therefore the density of the surrounding water, causing it to sink. This process is one of the main drivers behind the ocean’s global vertical circulation (the thermohaline circulation), which helps distribute energy around the planet. \n\nWhen the sea ice melts in the summer, it produces an influx of fresh water, adding to that from large rivers running in from Siberia and North America. This makes the Arctic Ocean much fresher than the salty Atlantic and Pacific. Ocean circulation is partly driven by temperature and salinity differences in the water, so changes to the cycle of sea ice freezing and melting can affect ocean currents and weather systems far from the Arctic.\n",

As traditional ways of hunting and travel are being disrupted, they have to adjust their lifestyles to the rapid warming. The sea ice that was such a barrier to European explorers provides a vital link for Greenlanders, both to food sources and between coastal communities. Waters that are becoming easier for a cruise ship to navigate are becoming more difficult for dogsled and snowmobile.\n\n![Permafrost 2003-2017](assets/story15_08.jpg)\n_Northern hemisphere permafrost 2003-2017 (data viewer placeholder image)._\n\nFrom Alaska to Siberia, modern infrastructure such as roads, buildings and oil pipelines are undermined as the frozen ground – permafrost – on which they are built thaws out. This also releases carbon dioxide and the more powerful greenhouse gas methane from the previously-frozen soil. Vast quantities of methane also lie trapped as frozen methane hydrates on the Arctic Ocean’s broad continental shelf, parts of which could also thaw as the temperature rises.\n\nMelt-water from the Greenland Ice Sheet has contributed 11mm to sea level rise since 1992 and is tracking the worst-case climate warming predictions. Being fresh water, it is a further disruption to the salinity balance in the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas. The flow of glaciers has also increased on islands such as Severnaya Zemlya as the surrounding ocean has warmed. Ice sheets, glaciers, permafrost and ocean salinity are, like sea ice, considered to be ‘essential climate variables’ that we need to monitor in order to understand how the climate is changing.\n",

      "text": "# Seeing in the Dark\n\nSatellites give us a unique overview of the polar regions, providing measurements that were previously impossible to acquire in the hostile environment of these vast and remote areas. But conventional cameras using visible light can only work during the daytime and in the absence of clouds, which is a problem in polar regions prone to bad weather and long periods of winter darkness. Here, microwaves, which can pass through clouds and don’t need the Sun as a source, are more useful. \n\nMicrowaves are emitted from the surface of the Earth and can be detected by passive sensors on satellites. They can also be generated by a satellite radar and sent out to illuminate the Earth’s surface. The European Space Agency has invested in a series of radar satellites that allow surface properties to be measured by analysing the reflected beam of microwaves.\n\n![CryoSat in orbit](assets/icesheet_large_17.jpg)\n_CryoSat, ESA's ice mission.

(ESA/NASA/Planetary Visions)_\n\nOne of the world’s longest satellite data archives, going back to 1978, is of passive microwave observations of sea ice. The CCI Sea Ice team is working with this data, in collaboration with Europe’s weather satellite organisation, EUMETSAT, to produce daily maps of sea ice concentration at both poles, as well as investigating more modern instruments to carry the data series forward. But ice extent is only half the story – climate modellers also want to know the volume of ice present.\n",

Radar altimeters are used to measure very precisely the height of the ice above the sea surface, from which its thickness can be derived. The CCI Sea Ice team has developed monthly sea ice thickness maps using radar altimeter data from ESA’s Envisat mission from 2002 to 2012, and from CryoSat, launched in 2010. The CCI Ice Sheet team also uses these satellite altimeters to measure the thickness of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.\n\t\nThe retrieval of sea ice thickness from altimetry works well only in the winter months, and only for relatively thick ice. The team is also looking at the novel use of data from ESA’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite (SMOS) to measure the thickness of thin ice, and at the new capabilities offered by future ESA satellites such as CRISTAL and CIMR. \n\nThe observed Arctic sea ice loss has been found to directly follow humanity’s cumulative carbon dioxide emissions: 3m2 of ice are lost in September for every tonne of carbon dioxide we add to the atmosphere. Climate models using the CCI data as an input show that, at current emission rates, it is likely that the Arctic Ocean will be largely ice-free in the summer before 2050.",
