00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.800
El Niño and La Niña are periodic disturbances
of the ocean-atmosphere system

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.720
that change weather patterns
around the world every few years.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.300
The ocean surface is exposed to winds, 
which help to drive the ocean currents.

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.000
In the tropical Pacific Ocean, the
trade winds blow from east to west.

<i>Sea-Surface Temperature measured by satellites</i>

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
In normal conditions,
the easterly trade winds 

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.500
push warm ocean surface water
to the western Pacific Ocean.

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.100
<i>Ocean Temperature</i>

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.900
This draws cold, deep water to the surface
along the coast of South America.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.940
This tongue of cooler water is nutrient rich,
providing food for an abundance of marine life.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.400
During El Niño, the trade winds weaken,
causing a build up of warm water

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.000
in the eastern Pacific, suppressing
the upwelling of cold water.

13
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.800
<i>Chlorophyll-a Concentration</i>

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.600
Without upwelling nutrients,
phytoplankton populations collapse,

15
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.980
as shown by satellite
measurement of ocean colour.

16
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.060
This can dramatically reduce the
fish catch off the coast of South America.

17
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.500
<i>Sea-Surface Temperature</i>

18
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.000
The warmer water also expands,
causing differences in the height

19
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.500
of the sea surface that can
be measured from space.

20
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.000
This is another way of tracking the
distribution of warm water

21
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.000
and the severity of an El Niño event.

22
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:51.200
As warm water builds up so does cloud cover,
due to increased evaporation of sea water.

23
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.500
When El Niño ends, the cold water
sometimes returns stronger than ever,

24
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.200
clearing a gap in the clouds as the local
climate enters its cool phase – La Niña.

25
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.500
<i>Soil Moisture Anomaly</i>

26
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.200
These changes to ocean temperature
and evaporation over the Pacific

27
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.960
lead to changes in rainfall
trends across the world.

28
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500
Certain areas can experience wetter
or drier conditions than normal,

29
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.000
which can lead to more flash floods,
drought or wildfires.

ESA’s Climate Change Initiative uses Earth
observation satellites to monitor and

39
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.560
measure the effects of El Niño and La Niña
in the context of a changing global climate.
