Within this delicate film – a layer of no more than 20 kilometres, from the deepest abyss in the ocean to the lower atmosphere – are found all the elements that enable life on Earth to exist.\r\n    \r\nThere is a constant exchange of vital elements such as water, oxygen and carbon between land, ocean and atmosphere, driven by the light and heat provided by the Sun. The Earth’s climate is a product of these complex processes. And Earth’s climate is changing. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other powerful greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the atmosphere, causing temperatures to rise. Over the last century the average land temperature has increased by more than one degree Celsius, and average sea level by about 20 centimetres.\r\n\r\nThere is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any time in the last 2.6 million years. Climate extremes are occurring more frequently, and even specific weather events can now be attributed to the human-driven increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since the industrial revolution. Climate models predict global average temperature will rise 2 to 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the twenty-first century, with major consequences for all components of the Earth system, including the ice sheets, the oceans, plants, animals and human society.\r\n\r\nClimate from Space explores some of the impacts of climate change and shows how they can be tracked using satellites orbiting the Earth.",

They are particularly useful for monitoring inaccessible areas such as the polar regions, where some of the changes to the climate are at their most extreme.\r\n \r\nThese ‘remote sensors’ measure sea ice expanding and contracting, the slow melt of glaciers and the burn of wildfires, track clouds and aerosols as they move through the atmosphere, and nutrient and temperature patterns swirling through the oceans.\r\n\r\nThe first operational remote sensing missions were in the late 1970s: this means we now have the opportunity to look back through forty years of observations for many climate components, which is long enough to start investigating climate change. However, compiling long time series of satellite data that are useful for climate scientists is a major challenge.\r\n\r\n## Changing Technology\r\n\r\nSatellites typically have a lifespan less than ten years. Other satellites then replace them, built with the latest technology. If they are to achieve consistent and reliable measurements, scientists must take into account differences between instruments, different measurement techniques, and gaps in coverage. \r\n\r\nThe work of these scientists and the climate data records they have produced is the focus of this web app. It includes an [interactive data viewer] where you can explore the climate data on 3D globes and 2D world maps.",
