      "text": "## Earth’s Climate\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the Earth is almost 13,000 kilometres. But life is found across no more than 20 kilometres, from the deepest abyss in the ocean up through the first layers of the atmosphere. If Earth were scaled down to the size of an apple, this would barely be the thickness of the skin. In this delicate film, the elements that enable life on Earth coexist and interact.\r\n    \r\nThere is a constant exchange of vital elements such as water, oxygen and carbon between land, ocean and atmosphere, driven by the light and heat provided by the Sun. The Earth’s climate is a product of these complex processes.\r\n    \r\nAnd Earth’s climate is changing. There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any time in the last 2.6 million years. Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, and is a powerful “greenhouse gas”, trapping heat in the atmosphere. Over the last century the average land temperature has increased by nearly one degree Celsius, and average sea level has risen by almost 20 cm.\r\n    \r\nClimate extremes are occurring more frequently, and even specific weather events can now be attributed to the human-driven increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since the industrial revolution. Climate models predict global average temperature will rise 2 to 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the twenty-first century, with major consequences for all components of the Earth system, including ice sheets, the oceans, plants, animals and human society.",

      "text": "## Tracking the Changes\r\n\r\nOver the past few decades, Earth observation satellites have given us an unprecedented view of our changing world and have become an essential tool to monitor climate at both local and global scales. They are particularly useful for monitoring inaccessible areas such as the polar regions, where some of the changes to the climate are at their most extreme.\r\n \r\nThese ‘remote sensors’ can measure sea ice expanding and contracting, monitor glaciers and fires, track clouds and aerosols moving through the atmosphere, as well as how nutrients and temperatures are changing across the oceans.\r\n\r\nThe first operational remote sensing missions were in the late 1970s: this means we now have the opportunity to look back through more than thirty years of observations for many climate components, which is long enough to start investigating climate change. However, compiling long time series of satellite data that are useful for climate scientists is a major challenge.\r\n\r\n## Changing Technology\r\n\r\nSatellites typically have a lifespan less than ten years. Other satellites then replace them, carrying newer technologies, with data in different file formats and standards. The first Earth observation records were on analogue tapes, while we now have instant, online access to vast digital data centres.\r\n \r\nScientists must take into account data from different instruments, using different measurement techniques, sometimes with gaps in their coverage, if they are to achieve consistent and reliable measurements. The work of these scientists is the focus of this web app, which includes an interactive data viewer where the climate data records they have produced can be explored.",

The CCI focuses on twenty-two of these variables, where European expertise in remote sensing can make a significant contribution, leveraging the thirty-year archive of data from the satellite missions of ESA and other space agencies.\r\n\r\nThe CCI science teams have merged observations from different missions and sensors into continuous series of data, providing stable, long-term data products to improve the information available to climate modellers and researchers. \r\n\r\nThe programme brings together more than 200 experts in a range of scientific, technical and development specialisations from across the European Earth observation community to offer lasting and transparent access to global climate data",

The accompanying texts tell stories about different parts of the Earth’s climate system, how we can track changes to those key climate variables, and how they affect human life. There is a little technical detail about the satellites and sensor technologies used and interviews with some of the project’s scientists, who describe what they do in their own words.\r\n\r\n## Exploring the Data\r\n\r\nThroughout the stories there are links to the interactive data viewer, enabling you to play, pause, rewind and step through the climate data, observing weekly, seasonal and long-term changes. Go to the Data Mode to access data from all the projects.\r\n\r\nYou can compare, side by side, some of the most accurate, consistent and long-running observations of our planet from space.
