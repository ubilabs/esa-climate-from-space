Carbon sinks remove carbon from the atmosphere, helping to offset natural and human carbon emissions. Whether an area is a carbon source or a sink can flip through the year, and in response to environmental changes such as droughts, wildfires and land use.\r\n\r\nESA’s Regional Carbon Cycle Analysis and Processes project (RECCAP2) uses satellites to measure land climate variables such as soil moisture and biomass. The L-band microwave radiometer on the SMOS satellite is sensitive to annual changes in vegetation, including forests.\r\n\r\nThese observations are combined with ground data and computer models to map global land carbon stocks. Earth’s forests store carbon as woody biomass, but environmental changes can impair their ability to absorb carbon.",
