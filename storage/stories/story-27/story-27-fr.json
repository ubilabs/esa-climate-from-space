The Russian capital, famous for its cold, hard winters, had reached 5.4 degrees Celsius – its highest December temperature since records began in 1879. A planned snow-boarding event went ahead only with the help of “snow” scraped from the surface of a nearby ice rink. Children were playing football in courtyards that usually host ice hockey games.\r\n\r\nRussia is warming 2.5 times faster than the global average, and many of the effects of climate change are amplified in large cities like Moscow. The expanding urban areas, in which an increasing number of us live, absorb and retain heat better than most natural cover types. \r\n\r\n## Extremes Amplified\r\n\r\nHeatwaves killed 70,000 people across Europe in 2003 and 55,000 in Russia alone in 2010. Cities are exposed to the most extreme temperatures in a heatwave, which can induce dehydration or heat stroke and increase the risk from stroke, heart and breathing conditions. While much is made of the rise in global mean temperature – about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade – the single-day temperature extremes experienced in heatwaves are rising faster. In cities with over 5 million people, the hottest day of the year is rising on average 0.33 degrees Celsius per decade and in Moscow, Paris and Houston, over 0.9 degrees Celsius per decade. The increased threat to life from one-day extremes is thought to be comparable to that from prolonged heat events.",

Ground-level infrared cameras are used to show where heat is being lost from buildings, so they can be made more energy-efficient. In the same way, infrared sensors on satellites can be used to show where heat is building up within a city. \r\n\r\nMeasurements of land surface temperature (LST) from space can be compared with historical data from weather stations to identify the areas of a city that are most vulnerable during heatwaves. This information can help urban planners improve the design of cities by deciding where to locate green areas, which materials to use, and how to orient buildings to maximise shade and cooling.\r\n\r\nLST data can also be linked with more detailed data from the ground or from airborne surveys, and updated in near-real time using high quality sensors such as the Copernicus Sentinel satellites to provide support to decision makers during heatwave events. LST from space can show how heatwaves affect temperature at the level of a district or even an individual city block. Understanding these events would allow steps to be taken which could potentially reduce the effect of heat-related health hazards. \r\n\r\nThe most accurate climate data for LST is from the European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative. Although of moderate spatial resolution, it is detailed enough to see key features of a large city like London, and its temperature measurements are extremely accurate. They provide a spatial snapshot of the surface temperature as well as a multi-decade temporal progression of temperature for a whole city, region, country or continent to improve the performance of [climate models](stories/story-31/0).",

      "text": "## Keeping a Lid on it\r\n\r\nUrban heat islands have an impact on many people today and, as urbanisation and climate change continue, many more will feel their effects in the future. Cities currently occupy approximately two percent of the Earth's surface and are home to more than half the world's people. By 2050, it is expected that 75 percent of a global population of 9.5 billion will live in cities. \r\n\r\nThere are ways to reduce the urban heat island effect. These include positioning buildings in a way that improves airflow, using new building materials that trap less heat than conventional materials and reintroducing nature into cities and buildings. Plants and trees provide shade, remove air pollution and soak up water, helping to prevent floods. They also cool the air by releasing water to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nUrban trees are also an effective [sink for carbon dioxide](stories/story-12/2), which they absorb very close to its sources in transport and industry, limiting the spread of this greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. In London, there are more trees than people and it is estimated that they store 380 tonnes of carbon per hectare in some parts of the city – comparable to some temperate and tropical rainforests.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, the city of Arnhem has decided to replace 10% of its road surface with grass, increase the area of shade by planting trees, and to ensure that 90 percent of its rainwater is absorbed into the soil rather than running into the sewer. Water raises the heat capacity of soil, so wet soil emits less heat than dry soil. But will such measures be enough to cool our overheating cities? Measuring land surface temperature, soil moisture and land cover type from space will help us answer that question.",
