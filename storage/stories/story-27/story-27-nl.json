      "text": "## Winter Heatwave\r\n\r\nFor the 2020 New Year celebrations in Moscow, they had to make artificial snow. The Russian capital, famous for its cold, hard winters, had reached 5.4°C – its highest December temperature since records began in 1879. A planned snow-boarding event went ahead only with the help of “snow” scraped from the surface of a nearby ice rink. Children were playing football in courtyards that usually host ice hockey games.\r\n\r\nRussia is warming 2.5 times faster than the global average, and many of the effects of climate change are amplified in large cities like Moscow. The expanding “urban area” land cover type, in which an increasing number of us live, absorbs and retains heat better than most natural cover types. \r\n\r\n## Extremes Amplified\r\n\r\nHeatwaves killed 70,000 people across Europe in 2003 and 55,000 in Russia alone in 2010. Cities are exposed to the most extreme temperatures in a heatwave, which can induce dehydration or heat stroke and increase the risk from stroke, heart and breathing conditions. While much is made of the rise in global mean temperature – about 0.2°C per decade – the single-day temperature extremes experienced in heatwaves are rising faster. In cities with over 5 million people, the hottest day of the year is rising on average 0.33°C per decade and in Moscow, Paris and Houston, over 0.9°C per decade. The increased threat to life from one-day extremes is thought to be comparable to that from prolonged heat events.",

      "text": "## Urban Heat Islands\r\n\r\nThe interactive globe shows the extent of different types of land cover, including urban areas as well as natural cover types like forest and desert. The large old cities of Europe can be seen as well as the explosive growth of cities like Shanghai in Asia since the start of the data record in the 1990s. Land cover is one of the variables measured by the European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative. Other climate variables measured from space are the temperature of the land surface and the amount of moisture in the soil. These and other variables can be used to get an objective view on the interaction between humans and nature, and how climate change might affect that interaction.   \r\n\r\n![urban and rural temperature profiles graph ](assets/story27-image04.png) \r\n_Comparison of monthly temperature profiles for urban  and rural weather stations in the UK (Heathrow and Waddington respectively) (Placeholder – KNMI)_    \r\n\r\nAs more and more people move into a city, large areas of vegetation are replaced by roads, parking areas and buildings. The materials used to construct these features have a much higher capacity to store heat than plants and soil.  They gain heat from solar illumination during the day and not all of it is lost at night. The energy consumed within factories, offices and homes also contributes to raising the temperature of the urban environment. Cities can be up to 7 degrees Celsius warmer than the surrounding countryside. Places where temperatures are elevated in this way are known as urban heat islands.",

      "text": "## Heat Surveys  from Space \r\n\r\nHow much an urban area is affected by its heat island depends on factors such as the number, type and arrangement of buildings and roads, and what they are made from. Ground-level infrared cameras are used to show where heat is being lost from buildings, so they can be made more energy-efficient. In the same way, infrared sensors on satellites can be used to show where heat is building up within a city. \r\n\r\nMeasurements of land surface temperature (LST) from space can be compared with historical data from weather stations to identify the areas of a city that are most vulnerable during heatwaves. This information can help urban planners improve the design of cities by deciding where to locate green areas, which materials to use, and how to orient buildings to maximise shade and cooling.\r\n\r\nLST data can also be linked with more detailed data from the ground or from airborne surveys, and updated in near-real time using high quality sensors such as the Copernicus Sentinel satellites to provide support to decision makers during heatwave events. LST from space can show how heatwaves affect temperature at the level of a district or even an individual city block. Understanding these events would allow steps to be taken which could potentially reduce the effect of heat-related health hazards. \r\n\r\nThe most accurate climate data for LST is from the European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative. Although of moderate spatial resolution, it is detailed enough to see key features of a large city like London, and its temperature measurements are extremely accurate. They provide a spatial snapshot of the surface temperature as well as a multi-decade temporal progression of temperature for a whole city, region, country or continent to improve the performance of climate models.",

      "text": "## Keeping a Lid on it\r\n\r\nAlthough satellites allow a lot of ground to be covered in a short time, the observations taken by their sensors need to be calibrated with _in situ_ measurements taken with conventional instruments on or near the surface. Satellites in most cases can only measure the surface. In the case of the temperature of the ocean this means much less than the top millimetre, so sea-surface temperature from satellite needs to be combined with data from ship-tethered or free-floating underwater probes to form a complete picture of ocean temperature.\r\n\r\nEarth observation specialists work with subject specialists ‘in the field’. This fieldwork is often an important part of designing a new satellite instrument or testing a new way of using existing satellite data. Fieldwork might involve the deployment of fixed instruments on the ground, drifting or gliding instruments in the ocean, or aircraft or balloon flights in the atmosphere. Scientists may spend months isolated in remote research stations in Antarctica or on board a ship locked in the Arctic sea ice. This ground-level work is an essential part of the calibration and validation of climate observations from space.\r\n\r\n![3D tree models ](assets/3dtrees_black.jpg) \r\n_The mass of carbon stored by trees can be estimated using 3D tree models based on laser scanning (lidar – light detection and ranging) (Placeholder – UCL or similar from CCI-Biomass or JRC)_",
