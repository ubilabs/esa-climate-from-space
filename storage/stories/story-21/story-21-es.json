      "text": "## Queensland, 2010\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Queensland experienced its wettest December on record, leading to a prolonged period of extensive flooding. The increased cloud cover and rainfall in northeast Australia was due to a disruption of temperature and evaporation patterns in the central Pacific Ocean known as [La Niña](stories/story-16/6). So much water accumulated on the land that an 18-month drop was recorded in mean global sea level. \r\n\r\nThis event shows how different parts of the Earth system – ocean, atmosphere and land – and locations separated by thousands of kilometres, are linked by the water cycle. It is a key component of Earth’s climate.\r\n\r\n## A Precious Resource\r\n\r\nWater is the world’s most precious resource. Without it there would be no life. Water has sculpted Earth’s landscape; we use it to grow crops and raise livestock, to generate electricity, in industrial processes, for transport and recreation. Lack of water puts life at risk in times of drought or wildfire. But water itself can also be a hazard. It may carry disease and pollutants, and too much water can cause damage and loss of life during times of flood or storm. The Queensland floods of 2010–11 affected 200,000 people and 35 died. Such extreme events are expected to become more frequent as the climate warms.",

Nearly all of this water – 97 per cent – is in the oceans that cover 70% of the planet’s surface. It changes between liquid, gas and solid, travelling through different parts of the Earth system in the water cycle. \r\n\r\nAs water moves from sea to atmosphere to land and back, energy is exchanged with the environment: water absorbs heat when it evaporates and releases heat when it condenses. The same processes are used by air conditioners and heat pumps to cool or heat our homes. These energy exchanges contribute to the circulation patterns in the ocean and atmosphere that [move heat around the planet](stories/story-16/2).\r\n\r\n## The Oceans\r\n\r\nThe oceans have a large capacity to store heat, and it is estimated they have absorbed 93 per cent of the excess heat generated by human activities since the 1970s. While this may have delayed some of the consequences of climate change, water expands as it warms up, contributing to [sea level rise](stories/story-30/1). This risk is amplified by storm surges, and the warmer oceans are fuelling larger, more powerful tropical cyclones – hurricanes in the Atlantic and typhoons in the Pacific.",

Only one litre out of every thousand litres of Earth’s water is in the atmosphere, but here it has a huge effect on the climate: water vapour is the most abundant of the greenhouse gases that ensure the surface of our planet is warm enough for life to thrive. \r\n\r\nAs a gas, water vapour is easily transported vast distances through the atmosphere, as shown by the weather satellite sequence. Winds channel atmospheric water vapour into relatively narrow bands – ‘atmospheric rivers’ –that can carry much more water than the Amazon River.\r\n\r\n## What’s Left Behind\r\n\r\nWhen water evaporates from the ocean, or when it freezes to form sea ice in the polar regions, salts that were dissolved in it are left behind, increasing the density of the remaining sea water. [Salinity](stories/story-16/5) is one of the key drivers of ocean currents and of the vertical transport of water and heat to and from the ocean depths. The salinity of the ocean is reduced in areas where precipitation is high, such as the inter-tropical convergence zone, and during climatic events such as [El Niño](stories/story-16/6), when a relatively fresh pool of surface water can extend across the Pacific.",

When it reaches 100 percent, the air is saturated and water condenses around tiny particles of sand, salt, volcanic ash and soot (collectively known as aerosols) to form clouds of liquid water droplets. These water droplets are tiny, relatively buoyant, and can easily evaporate in less humid air, so not all clouds bring rain.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of a cloud depend on the number and type of aerosol particles: for example, more particles produce more and smaller droplets, which make the cloud brighter. More droplets form if the supply of water is maintained, or if the air cools, allowing it to carry less moisture. Air cools as it rises to pass over high ground, or if it moves over a cold ocean current or land mass. \r\n\r\n## Cloud Distribution\r\n\r\nThe data globe shows areas of heavy cloud cover, such as the persistent band of rising warm, moist air over the Equator. Clouds regularly form over mountain ranges such as the Andes, as air is forced upwards and cools. Cold air descends at mid-latitudes around 30 degrees North and South, giving rise to cloudless deserts.\r\n\r\nCloud droplets collide and merge with their neighbours as they are blown around by wind and updrafts. If enough droplets get together – a million or so – they become a raindrop, too heavy to remain suspended in the air.",

      "text": "## Water on the Land\r\n\r\nRain falling to the ground is absorbed into the soil and runs over the surface as streams and rivers. Water is stored on land as soil moisture and groundwater, in lakes and when we build dams to form artificial reservoirs. Some of this water is extracted for drinking and for use in industry and agriculture. Water is lost from the land by evaporation, by transpiration through plants, or by flowing through rivers back into the ocean. \r\n\r\nSoil moisture plays an important role in the development of [heatwaves](stories/story-27/1). As soil moisture decreases in warm conditions, positive feedback occurs: there is less evaporative cooling, which leads to a rise in air temperature and the cycle of warming continues. The animation shows soil moisture anomalies – deviations from the average conditions for each location and time of year.\r\n\r\n## Water and Carbon\r\n\r\nThere are several links between the water cycle and the [carbon cycle](stories/story-12/2). When plants extract water from the ground it contains dissolved nutrients. Water and nutrients are combined with carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight to produce sugars that add to the plant’s body, allowing it to grow. This process – photosynthesis – also happens in ocean plants called phytoplankton, which take up carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater rather than extracting it from the air.",

      "text": "## The Cryosphere\r\n\r\nIf the air is cold enough, clouds may form from ice crystals instead of water droplets. Ice crystals group together and fall to the ground as hailstones or snowflakes. During the northern winter snow covers up to 47 million square kilometres – about half the northern hemisphere’s land surface. It is released as huge amounts of meltwater in spring and summer. \r\n\r\nIn cold regions, fallen snow can survive the summer thaw and accumulate into permanent areas of ice – glaciers in high mountain areas across the world, and the thick [ice sheets](stories/story-15/5) that cover most of Greenland and Antarctica. Most of Earth’s fresh water – 68 per cent – is locked up in ice sheets, ice shelves and glaciers. Another 1.2 per cent is in the form of sea ice, lake ice, permafrost and snow. Together these different types of frozen water form Earth’s cryosphere. They are sensitive to even small temperature fluctuations, making them key indicators of climate change. Ice is generally found in remote and inaccessible regions, and so best monitored from space.\r\n\r\n## Melting Ice\r\n\r\nGravity causes glaciers and ice sheets to flow downhill, to either melt in the warmer air at lower altitude, or break off into the sea as icebergs. Most of this water has been in a frozen state for millions of years, but as Earth warms, melting increases and the process of release has begun. Ice sheets are currently the largest contributor to [sea level rise](stories/story-30/5) and, although ten times smaller than Antarctica, it is the Greenland Ice Sheet that is the biggest source of meltwater entering the world’s oceans. This influx of fresh water is changing the salinity, and therefore the density, of adjacent seas and this may affect ocean circulation far from the poles. Most glaciers across the world are also retreating. A recent study estimates a trillion tonnes of ice is being lost each year.",

The global view offered by satellites helps, and scientists use a wide range of remote sensing technologies to monitor water from space. The European Space Agency’s [Climate Change Initiative](stories/story-32/3) is exploiting this satellite data archive to analyse some of the most important climate variables. More than half of those that can be measured from space involve or influence the water cycle: sea surface temperature and salinity, sea level, sea state, ocean colour, water vapour, cloud, aerosols, snow, soil moisture, lakes, glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost and sea ice. \r\n\r\nPutting these pieces of the jigsaw together helps us to understand how the water cycle works, how it affects the climate, and how changes to the climate might affect the water cycle. A warmer climate means more evaporation, and more precipitation as rain instead of snow. We can already see large changes in the distribution of water between the different reservoirs of the hydrosphere. Some of these redistributions are temporary, such as the shift from sea to land in the wake of the 2010 La Niña, but some are permanent, like the shift from land and sea ice to ocean water. Although largely driven by heat from the Sun, there are signs that the water cycle is being supercharged by the warming climate.",
