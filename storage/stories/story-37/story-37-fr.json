In healthy bogs, peat moss does not fully decay, and instead slowly builds up to form layers of carbon-rich peat. However, if the bog dries out, or is damaged by fire, the carbon is released – adding to the effects of climate change. The Flow Country is the largest remaining expanse of blanket bog in Europe, and it is estimated that the carbon stored equals 100 years’ worth of Scotland’s fossil fuel emissions. Satellite imagery can be used to create maps of peatlands, measure soil moisture, and detect disturbances such as fires, making it cheaper and easier to monitor and preserve these valuable landscapes. \r\n\r\nCredits: contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2018, 2019), processed by ESA, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO",
