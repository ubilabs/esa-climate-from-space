      "text": "## Counting Carbon\r\n\r\nSince the industrial revolution, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide have been accumulating in the atmosphere, causing Earth’s temperature to rise. The 2015 Paris Agreement adopted a target for global warming not to exceed 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. This sets a limit on the additional carbon we can add to the atmosphere – the carbon budget, measured in gigatonnes of carbon (GtC). Only about 17% of the carbon budget is now left. That’s 10 years at current emission rates.\r\n\r\nEach country reports its annual greenhouse gas emissions to the UN. Scientists then set these emissions against estimates of the carbon absorbed by the Earth’s natural carbon sinks. This is known as the bottom-up approach to calculating the carbon budget.\r\n\r\nAnother way to track carbon sources and sinks is to measure the amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from space – the top-down approach. As well as tracking atmospheric carbon, ESA’s Climate Change Initiative is using satellite observations to track other carbon stocks on land and sea. How we use the land accounts for about a quarter of our greenhouse gas emissions. Forests and their soils are the largest store of carbon on the land. Fire acts as a conduit for carbon to pass from the land to the atmosphere. Phytoplankton growing in the ocean are an important carbon sink.\r\n\r\nESA's Regional Carbon Cycle Analysis and Processes project is using this information to reconcile the differences between the bottom-up and top-down approaches. Observations are combined with atmospheric and biophysical computer models to deduce carbon fluxes at the surface. This will improve the precision of each greenhouse gas budget and help separate natural fluxes from agricultural and fossil fuel emissions.\r\n\r\nThis work will help us gauge whether we can stay within the 1.5°C carbon budget, or if we’ll have to deal with the more severe consequences of further warming.\r\n\r\n(Data from CCI RECAPP2, Greenhouse Gases, Land Cover, Biomass, Fire, Ocean Colour projects, Global Carbon Project, UN World Population Prospects 2019.
