No matter what happens to greenhouse gas emissions in the future, it is expected to be, within a few decades, the first country to become uninhabitable due to climate change.\r\n\r\nThe islands of Kiribati are small and low-lying, mostly scattered across 32 coral atolls, where they surround saltwater lagoons rich in marine life. Polynesian people have inhabited the islands for thousands of years, living in close harmony with nature and the ocean around them. Life revolves around the rise and fall of the tides, which dictate the timing of fishing and the availability of transport. But now the rising ocean is their biggest threat.\r\n\r\nThe islands’ 115,000 people eat mainly seafood, coconut, breadfruit and taro roots. Drinking water is drawn from freshwater aquifers below the atolls. The islands are only a few tens to hundreds of metres wide and typically rise no higher than two metres above sea level. This makes Kiribati one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially sea level rise.",

      "text": "## Melting Ice\r\n\r\nGlobal warming is causing polar ice sheets and glaciers to melt, adding more water to the oceans. Warming water also expands, causing the height of the sea’s surface to rise. Mean sea level rose by about 15 centimetres during the last century and is currently rising more than twice as fast – at 3.6 cm per decade – the highest for 3,000 years. The rate is increasing and mean sea level is expected to rise 30–110 cm by 2100 – sufficient to overwhelm large parts of low-lying countries such as Kiribati.\r\n\r\nDuring storms and spring tides, parts of the islands are already regularly inundated and people are used to living with wet feet from time to time. The combination of high tides, sea level rise and storm waves also leads to severe coastal erosion. This puts the squeeze on the islands’ already tight living space. Some uninhabited islands have already been lost, and several villages have been moved inland.\r\n\r\n## Coral Crisis\r\n\r\nBut that’s not the only worry for the people of Kiribati: rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are leading to ocean acidification, which, along with pollution, poses a threat to the coral reef and fishing stocks. As the sea level rises, salt water contaminates fresh water aquifers and damages crops, putting great pressure on the available food and water supplies.\r\n\r\nCoastal erosion is mitigated in the short term by sea walls made from sand bags, car tyres and oil drums, and mangrove forest restoration bolsters the natural coastal defences. In the longer term, it might be possible to raise the height of the land surface with sand dredged from the lagoons. However, it is unclear whether the living coral that underpins the atolls can grow quickly enough to keep up with the rising sea level. The reefs are currently far from healthy, and growth rates are already declining due to stresses from raised water temperatures, ocean acidification, coral bleaching and pollution.",

      "text": "## Highs and Lows\r\n\r\nEarth observation satellites can use radar to accurately measure the height of the sea surface, allowing us to investigate how it varies through time and across the globe. In some areas, sea level rise can be five times that of the global average. This is mostly because variations in the amount of heat stored lead to uneven thermal expansion. This and other factors tend to amplify the sea level rise in tropical regions such as the central Pacific. Differences in salinity and local gravity also play a part.\r\n\r\nAbsolute measurements of sea level show the trend over years and decades. Changes from month to month show up more clearly if we work out sea level anomalies by calculating the difference between the level each month and a reference level. On the interactive globe this baseline is the average sea surface height at each point over the period 1993 to 2009. Run through the timeline to see where the sea is unusually high or low compared with mean sea level for a particular month.  \r\n\r\nThe most extreme sea level variations are around strong ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio Current in the North Pacific, where the motion of the current on the rotating Earth causes a slope in the sea surface. These currents are also clearly visible in the sea surface temperature data, shown on the other globe.\r\n\r\nThere is a seasonal cycle due to thermal expansion: sea levels are higher in the summer when the sea surface temperature increases. Sea level is, therefore, a good way of tracking the movement of heat around the oceans as well as the movement of water itself. \r\n\r\nThe globes also show variation between years, such as changes caused by the warming of the Pacific Ocean surface during El Niño events. Check out the El Niño years of 1997, 2003, 2010 and 2015 to see how much the sea level rises around Kiribati in the central Pacific.",

His motto was to “migrate with dignity\" rather than flee as refugees. To be prepared, he purchased 20 sq km of land 2,000 km away on Fiji and urged his people to get ready for relocation. For Kiribati, climate change presents the likelihood of a whole nation being scattered around the globe and an ancient culture disappearing. \r\n\r\nAnd this is not only a distant problem. In the UK, the Welsh town of Fairbourne is to be abandoned because it cannot be defended from the expected rise in sea level. In the USA, an area of land the size of a football field is being lost from the Mississippi delta every hour. Land subsidence is amplifying the effects of sea level rise, causing maps to be redrawn and the first American refugees from the climate crisis, with the resettlement of the community living on the Isle de Jean Charles announced in 2016. \r\n\r\nSixty-five per cent of the world’s major cities are located within 100 km of the coast. 680 million people live in low-lying coastal zones, a number that is rising with an increasingly urban population and expected to reach one billion by 2050. Although an annual increase in sea level of 3.6 mm may seem small, it is amplified during high tides and storm surges. Every centimetre of sea level rise puts 6 million more people at risk of coastal flooding.\r\n\r\nSince climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of storms, the risk of flooding events such as those that hit New Orleans in 2005 and New York in 2012 is growing. In some regions extreme sea level events previously seen only once a century are likely to occur every year by 2050.",

      "text": "## The Sea Level Budget\r\n\r\nTo accurately measure sea level rise, attribute its causes and analyse the potential impacts, we need consistent data from observations across the globe. Identifying the individual contributors to sea level rise involves tracking water as it moves around the world in all its states – solid, liquid and gas – and this makes it one of the most complicated challenges in climate science. ESA’s Climate Change Initiative has examined records of satellite data collected since the 1990s covering sea level, the temperature of the sea surface and the thickness of the polar ice sheets, and information about the world’s glaciers going back to the 1960s. \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that in the decade 2003–2013, 36% of sea level rise was meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; 30% was due to thermal expansion; 20% from melting glaciers; and 10% was due to groundwater extracted from aquifers for domestic, industrial and agricultural use that is ultimately discharged to the oceans. Although the contributions are all following an upward trend, they vary through time and don’t always add up to the observed total sea level rise. Bridging this gap in our knowledge is known as closing the sea level budget, and is an important focus for climate scientists. \r\n\r\nThe integration of new data from ESA satellites such as CryoSat, Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6 will improve our knowledge of this key climate variable. Consistent and continuous information from multiple sources will help us better understand sea level change and its impacts, and evaluate the adaptation options for the inhabitants of Kiribati and the world’s other coastal populations.",
